36,Digital rupees will be more beneficial for government to manage the currency but for normal people UPI is doing the same thing. After retail digi we will have one more real time payment option.
37,"Bold move, but they could've avoided including chinese bank (HsBc) in its initial operations."
38,another imp ascpect of digital currency is that it will help preventing evasion of money from financial system as due to this reason only govt has reduced circulation of Rs. 2k notes

48,From where we can get digital rupee
49,@studyiq Will the value of digital rupee be equal to the value of printed rupee?   Will bank help us with cash in exchange of this digital rupee?
50,How is it going to be different from the money lying in our bank account ?? This CBBC concept is just irrational. What purpose will it be going to serve if the intrinsic value will be the same as INR.

98,agar ye digital ruppe crypto ki tarah trade nhi ho sakta to is ruppe ka 1% bhi fayda nhi hai crypto me log isi liye investment karte hai kyuki wo trade hota hai or profit loss sab hota hai
99,No i have read it and most of the criticizing from people claiming to be bank and financial expert is not correct about clarity on this coz first something gets launch after that govt makes changes in it to make it better in starting for retail sector for genral public you can say it's more like a virtual wallet cash or points so to make it better in future govt can frame a law where these rules can be implemented in stopping reward points directly through app or can be rewarded as e rupee to shop and in future who knows maybe you will get start 10-20 rs of e rupee on products for free so i do feel if govt goes ahead in correct direction then it can have a future at a time when blockchain and other farms of digital currency is not much allowed here

The reason the public don't know about them is because they use their  m@sonic agents all over the world as a FRONT to conceal their identity and fool the public into focusing on the wrong enemy of humanity"

For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 1 Corinthians 15:1‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨4 KJV that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Romans 10:9 KJV Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. John 14:6 KJV For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8‚Ä≠-‚Ä¨9 KJV"

197,Good analysis
198,This Rajan guy believes that India should not focus on manufacturing at all. He is probably the only 'wellwisher' of any country to think that üòÉ. This is just one of his focus areas and I have almost 0 trust in things he is concerned about so much so that if he is criticising any decision of Indian govt I tend to get a positive feeling about that decision already üòÉ. What happens with CBDC only time will tell. Let's see how this experiment goes.
199,Good explanation but the title of the video is inaccurate. e-RUPI and Digital Rupee (CBDC) are different. The video title assumes both to be same.
200,They are  just trying to monitor our every transactions more deeply
201,"Erupi is also instrument to send money but it is different than upi as in upi you send money directly from bank 2 bank by same person . In erupi one person can create voucher and give to some one else so they can use that voucher wherever it is decided by person who created it . It is exactly like amazon shopping voucher where someone can create voucher by paying amazon some money and give it to anyone to shop on Amazon only. In case of erupi usage is not limited to shopping but it can be used many places .Currently not much details is available but as per my knowledge this will be game changer as it will reduce misuse of money both in government and corporate. Government now can create erupi and give it to farmer to buy only seeds in the form of seed subsidy instead of giving money to farmer account( DBT) where it is not gurantee whether farmer will buy seed or something else. Corporate now can issue erupi voucher to there employee for there outstation visits for hotel access and travel expense instead of forcing employee to submit proof of expense Health insurance company can simply go away with cashless card instead they can issue erupi to there customer which can only be used in designated hospital which will save there Hugh money. It's usage can be many in future we will just see this to happen. Once the adoption rate goes up , cash economy will vanish over long term.  Why do you not see these benefits from cbdc? Rgs. Drdurgadoss. Drdd"
202,"Then its like bitcoin? Then money with credit or debit done it by cbdc that be at  public banks,but not with RBI.RBI controls it ,yes/no. Cbdc is like wallet?"
203,"Our economy is in such a bad shape spending printed money , that's worth nothing . We have so much to pray about .. You've helped me and my family With your advices imagine investing $ 1000 and receiving $ 8,350 in few days with Ms Ana this inflation has increased drastically investment is the best idea"
204,"This video is basically ill-informed on almost every aspect- The money one holds in bank A/C or in wallets is digital money for the user, not for RBI. RBI had to print notes in physical form somewhere at any point in time. e-rupi will be completely digital ie- produced and transferred.  RBI tends to gain control over anything which involves money, they are bestowed power and responsibility to control the inflation by a statute.   your views are highly political and misinformed. Even though you did not call any names, one can observe you're giving a negative connotation  to this initiative merely because you don't like the government.  This video needs to be reported on a mass!"
205,"E-Rupi  Ability to give Loans directly to corp-orates by RBI ( practically Government)  is little bit dangerous as Capitalists are controlling most of the government policies by funding elections which in turn is returned by cheap loans to them . Disaster is waiting ahead if this Adani/Ambani fails . I suspect they have huge NPA hidden  below carpet as Banks do not have privacy issues in disclosing  small retail loan defaults but Big defaults/NPA they &quot;See&quot; privacy issues , even Supreme court agrees !!"
206,"Government will have all the knowledge of flow of money , this will help them to collect more tax from middle class family, earlier it was easier to save by family,  Every thing is changing buy why not Govt is increasing its basic exemption limit from last more than 5 year basic exemption is fixed 2.5/3/5 lakh ?  Why 80c deduction is only Till 1.5 lakh from last many year ?  There are very different Questions which Government must think ."
207,"Pl go slow to understand it would be easier,"
208,"thank you so much, it was really helpful."
209,Digital Rupee won‚Äôt change anything right now but in future it might help Govt to track black money if adopted on wide scale
210,the centralised control of everything is always has it's threats. this move can even make easy to stash black money and transactions. cool
211,"Good Video. But it is premature to conclude that it doesn't have major advantage. Just imagine a use case: On successful testing of CBDC, if Govt comes with a decision of all major transactions more than 10L(just an example), must be via CBDC, this may remove black money (For Ex. Real estate, Gold purchase etc.,).Lets wait and watch"
212,One of the main advantages of this new distributed ledger is it will not leave any scope for physical intentional tampering of the subledgers held by the banks which eventually leads to an incomplete main ledger visible to the RBI.
213,"Comparing Chinese Muslims problem with CBDC was really stupid  When we have technology where no middleman (banks) are required, why to give chance of any manipulation.  Corruption is eating the whole country from years and with small reasons now people shall be given chance to do anything they want. Anyways RBI already collects data from the banks with information system which is mandatory for banks to provide."
214,üëç great job bro for making such we‚Äôll explained video
215,@akshat Is it not due to crypto currencies popularity that government is also launching its own official crypto currency? what about tamper proof and auditing capabilities? Aren't they advantages of digital currency?
216,Jo chacha hai wo hi Bhatia hai aur jo Bhatia hai wo hi chacha hai
217,Nice information thank you so much sir explain very easy and simple language English I understand. My English is very week but I understanding
218,"it is centerlized control, I don;t see any benifit of it."
219,"Taking Piyush Goyal and Raghuram Rajan statement is so lame. Also the video does not do justice to the point that it can help targetted DBT, e.g. money given for fertilizer can be used for intended purpose.   Another lame and funny argument was, why you created JAM, when you had to create e-rupi. Bro - there's is a word called evolution and concurrent existence of two systems is alright. NEFT, UPI,RTGS all exist today.  There are multiple other stupid argument as well,"
220,Clearly left leaning commentator. however if politics in video are kept aside information is there to be absorbed. will suggest akshat not to show bias during content creation
221,Hello sir I am a beginner and want to start my SIP in MF with 10k per month for 15 to 20 yeras. Can you suggest how many MF's should be there in my portfolio and what are they please üôèüôèüôè
222,Your efforts are welcome.
223,Digital money sai
224,Father of nation ko sab bol Jaye gai
225,I am against digital money because I respect Ghandhi ji plz don't change money modi is against great freedom fighter so he decided
226,"Very nicely explained. Yes, private banks will be starved of money for loan purpose. Maybe govt wants to monitor pvt banks that extend loans."
227,"Will RBI Do the mining to issue Digital rupee like z,Bitcoin etc ?"
228,i think there are fallacy in your argument.  RBI is not getting into credit.  it has been issuing notes in physical form ; not is issuing in digital currency ; the currency in circulation even today is decided by RBI/Finance ministry ; there is not transparent formula that is being used or public by neither rbi nor finance ministry.  in fact RBI has started SGL-for bonds and now citizen open the account directly. this is to save the cost for the GOI as they had to pay money to the intermediaries being bank.
229,looks like you are reacting too early like small children and popcorn youtubers. reference to rajan and uguhrs shows your where you are heading. please restrain from one sided views .
230,If u want to beat around the bush..please don't put titles to confuse viewers..u are wasting time..
231,Soon other banks will close because they will have no work hence banks will close and RBI will take complete control.. Then there will be no physical currency in circulation rupee will die and only digital rupee of RBI will function. This will be another disaster like demonetzation of indian rupee complete. God save india from disaster. Very bad future.poor man will be at hardship to survive.
232,This system of govt control can and sure one day bring india into bankruptcy. Very dangerous trend and system of governence.
233,Very sad that govt is taking complete control of public money. Yes the top govt officials and politicians will have control of your and my money and has every chance of duping the public at large. This is like china that our govt too wants to control our money and miss use them for their benefit.
234,"Hello Akshat, need some help and advice. I had sent money from my bank account to Vested direct account. I then changed my mind and want to withdraw money out of it. But unable to do it. Can u help please"
235,Thank you sir great job
236,you should host a debate with two sides - pros and cons - of CDBC. Will be interesting to see you and Think School's Ganesh Prasad üòÖ

239,Not worthy
240,I would rather live in bangladesh than use erupee.
241,"Hi Akshat, my knowledge of CBDC is all from this video, but here's the benefit I see:  Since this system skips the layer of private banks during transactions, this will bring enormous transparency and accountability on transactions.  Think about the following: - Tax transparency - Debt / Loan transparency - International transactions accountability (funding of terror and / or black money)  Also, since CBDC is a blockchain network (centralised, but anyway) it can also make eRupi an alternative for blockchain applications / businesses to use instead of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Although, Polygon or other blockchains might be a better choice at the moment, but it's the first initiative by Govt in the blockchain space and with time it might actually evolve into a viable option.  It mostly benefits the government, but I don't consider the &quot;janta&quot; to be separate from the government. I don't think this a zero sum game between government and the masses.  Again I am not sure about how it works and if these benefits will ever occur, but this is what I can see right now"
242,"This is being done to end the role of comml banks  because now there will be no need to open bank accounts . And gen public is going to be hit hard because than only few 2/3 banks will remain and wont give even 6 % int like present. Public will have to invest in capital fds , thereby benefitting cspitalists ."
243,"The Govt. officials like corporators and MLAs are doing some scams in a different way that they are wasting lots of money to build unnecessary gates, banners and statues, etc. and also doing district, taluka, railway station etc re-naming process.. This money is our Taxes so way they are doing it and wasting so much money. Whether its really needed to do this. ??  Even when they took their meetings they are just enjoying their lunch, dinner, etc. This also our Tax money .. why ?? We giving the power to them all this shit ??"
244,"Main purpose of CBDC is to create an Internationally tradable currency without using any of the current payment networks like Swift, which are controlled by West. In an eventual case of sanctions as in case of Russia where Swift payments were blocked disrupting trade this would help.   So in case CBDC is successful we would have a mechanism in place to trade globally without much disruption.  Second reason is INR is highly dependent on USD and hence is volatile. If trade happens in INR, importers &amp; exporters need not worry of Currency risk.  Making INR more stable,  creating lot value for business in the long run."
245,I totally did not get the point where the China's people surveillance system is compared with the CBDT

247,"Its e-rupee n not e-rupi, Misleading content"
248,Sir it may not succeed because politicians Nd businesses man cannot hide black money . This is my thought.
249,jam yojana will be introduced because currently government is giving money to farmers and poor people. but government cant control how people will spend this money. so they will create voucher. which will people avail only on specific shops. for example if you are giving 5000‚Çπ worth of voucher to farmer he can avail in fertiliser shops or equipment shops only. that way money will not be wasted for other purposes.
250,"Sir,  I sincerely believe this is a Politically sponsored content to defame the present Govt. by comparing it with Chinese Govt.  Now, redo your Research, keeping the following points in mind: Have you ever seen the trucks loaded with cash, picking up notes and coins from each Branch and ATM across India? Are you aware of the cost of printing a Note, replacing the torn notes, cost of minting a coin and do you believe The Govt. of India is losing money from it? Are you aware of the massive counterfeit notes being circulated in the Economy and the losses the Banks and RBI bears by exchanging them with genuine currency in genuine cases? Are you aware of the cost of importing the Ink and paper used in printing currency notes? Are you aware what percentage of population still do not have Bank Accounts or Mobile phones? Are you aware of the cost of internet on mobiles and the distribution of education of users  using the apps and percentage of users using non-smart phones? Are you aware that Demonetisation happened to minimise the use of bigger currency notes by the Neighbouring countries and the cost of such an excercise by the Govt. of India for replacing and distributing the new notes? Are you aware that RBI has indicated that any transaction below ‚Çπ2 Lac will not be reported for KYC. Are you aware that the total losses India incurred due to the CryptoCurrency menace, which could have been powering our Economy? Are you aware that small retailers, TSR drivers, even Doctors practicising, daily workers don't accept any kind of UPIs for the fear of getting included in GST and thus Cash has flown back in the Economy? Are you aware of the losses that happen due to pickpocketing, theft, robberies, losing cash in Commercial vehicles of the normal people? Are you aware that even cash can be black-marketed, like when you buy the Noton ki Gaddi for Marriage and BrideGroom's necklace? Are you aware of the massive amounts certain vendors make, by claiming lack of chillar in return of a purchase? Are you aware of the expenses that we make by using Visa, Master, Swift and International Shopping?  Are you aware of the huge losses one makes while exchanging currencies for Foreigners? Are you aware of the trouble of buying vegetables and either carrying ample change or buying additional vegetables or getting refused by the vendors or Auto Drivers or even Bus Conductors? Are you aware of the amount of cash which goes to Pandits, outside the Dan-Patras? Are you aware that India Post still offer stamps and revenue stamps at an extremely reasonable rates?  I have just given you a glimpse of what a Chillarh wallet, which has Cash, just like a Metro or Travel Card or a Mobile Tap can save you from all this trouble and anyone just has to send an sms and Chillarh gets transferred to the Wallet of the other person, just like a Ledger Entry in the Matrix or Blockchain world, Debit 1 account, Credit 1 accoynt and Money stays with Central RBI's account.   And all this will save our problems in having limited Free Transactions or remembering N passwords for Banking apps and will also monitor the Economy's state, which at present does not take into account Cash Transactions. All this will give a true picture of Real size of Indian Economy and will help us get closer to the $5Tn target. It is absolutely not to track every user and datapoints, my dear.  I hope, it helps you in getting a &quot;Think out the Box&quot; perspective of what the Govt. and RBI have in mind.  All these are my personal observations and thoughts and do not represent anything else."
251,"It felt strange that you went so soft on e-Rupi. Government can invalidate your e-Rupi after certain period of time if you do not spend the money in order to keep economy in good shape. Government can prevent you from spending your own money on some of the things if they want to. With e-Rupi government can directly debit the money from your account with out your permission if you participate in dharnas, protests etc. Basically Government can enforce everything it wants, crushing individual freedom, choice. We all know what happens to such societies."
252,A great explanation akshat ur eloquancy and knowledge are truly outstanding
253,There is no point in breaking your head about what is CBDC and how its different from the old system and why the govt. is struggling to communicate the benefits of CBDC to the public. The reality is that it wipes off currency notes from the system and the CBDC is a &quot;programmable currency&quot;. The govt' will now have a complete control on your spending as it will programme the currency in a way that you can spend a part of your money only on specific/designated items in the economy. In simple the Govt. can decide where you spend the money and how much you should spend and even whether it should block your money if you speak against the govt. This is nothing but the beginning of the SOCIAL CREDIT SYSTEM. When the Prime Minister of the country shouts at the top of his voice about the &quot;New World Order&quot; in the Parliament several times since past few years why isn't the public serious about it and still believe that these are just conspiracy theories.
254,In short CBDC is a merchant account with the RBI instead of having an account with commercial bank. And this might be backed by a block chain infrastructure.
255,"are you a puppet of IMF, WORLD BANK &amp; INDIAN GOVT. which explain this matter not with a cons only with pros why?"
256,what about if banks starts to charge for upi payments then e rupi can play crucial role
257,"Wonderfully explained ! Thank you for clarifying, i was also confused."
258,Thanks a lot
259,"The adoption of CBDC for revenue expenditure is going to help curb the wide spread corruption. By making it mandatory to make all contraual work payments through CBDC tokens only, which normally generate significant portion of black money, it would make all such transactions open for investigation. Having said that, the system must overcome the shortcoming you mentioned to make it more viable for wider usage."
260,Awesome
261,Vo you know something? As a complete layman I wondered ( and wonder now) what benfit to the concumer or the government the e-rupi( CBDC) would bring. I am relieved that you think that there would be no benefit at all. So I'm going to eatch this space.
262,1.Easy money transfer between countries in bilateral trades 2.BRICS is working on a currency to counter USD domination in market and it is said that this currency will be a digital currency backed by gold or even commodities because recently Saudi wants to join the BRICS 3. So according to me the use of this type of currency is more on the international trade rather than domestic
263,"Blind rush to technology will lead to disaster. First,all the adhaar cards of dead be deactivated. A life certificate every six months is necessary. Any account without living certificate should be blocked.There are chances of benami and dummy accounts  hiding black money. Some food for the government before doing gaga under technology. Best known fact is no bank spends  on security,also the government.Block chain will make it difficult to trace  the identity. Its easy for RBI to declare  policy  to save the banks and execute the customer for the system fault.All like MALLAYA AND MODI WILL BE AWAY FROM THE COUNTRY."
264,CBDC is a Digital prison for the whole world. The sooner people recognise this the better it is. CBDC is the best tool for any dictatorial authoritarian rule. CBDC can be used to shut any individual or a group permanently just by switching them off digitally. Any one having different political opinion other than the government in control can be isolated permanently from the illusory digital financial services. You simply don't exist. Dangerous trend.
265,"The best use for cbdc with a centralized ledger is to make sure we have a transparent system between loans being given to states from the center and it's utilization by states and vice versa for revenues being collected from states as part of cgst and sgst. If cbdc centralized ledger can utilise this through blockchain , it gives the citizens a lot of insight . But in relation to the video, the options where this is being utilized make no sense üòÇ"
266,e-rupi is purpose specific there is no cash involvement anywhere whereas in DBT beneficiary gets direct money which gives discretionary power to use this money for any purpose even purchasing gutka too... a/c to me e-rupi is just one step ahead in initiating welfare to the people efficiently.
267,It's not bank fd and sb for earning interest
268,"Simply awesome @Akshat sir, the topic is indeed complex but you made it too lucid for any amateur... thanks !"
269,no words i am just 200% agreed
270,"I see this being used to provide Govt subsidies directly to people and reduce misuse of these money. Example, I have seen farmers take agri loans and buy cars and other luxury items. If the smart contracts are brought into action, govt/banks will put the erupi into bank account and the farmer can only use it for fertilizers, seeds/plantations, rentals for agri based vehicles and services and so on. This way we are plugging the leaks in a more polite manner. If govt takes action, then majority of the people will start protesting - hence this step. I could be wrong, but its only another way of understanding."
271,UPI was not developed and institutionalised by raghuram rajan...  It was Nandan nilenkani team that developed india stack...
272,great video as usual
273,Great Analysis....
274,The major reason is central government is subsidizing upi transaction due to multiple merchants involved  as amount of upi transactions are increasing leaps and bounds it will cost lot more. There might be possiblity that in future upi transactions are charged as well like imps so CBDC could be an alternative to that plus adoption of blockchain technology which is transparent and much safe as well could be promoted.
275,"The biggest problem in India is tracking government money allocated to needed people that will be solved, don't expect one implementation can solve everything in india"
276,"Absolutely wrong interpretation of digital Rupi by Akshat. You are simply misguiding people against an  excellent format of currency, Akshat. This digital currency will largely minimize the leakage of DBT money. Lot other benefits are also there."
277,"If everyone is using UPI and if we pay directly from our account to other account isn't that call digital money,do we need another digital money??i think what we are doing is just fine,we can pay  using UPI and when we want cash we can withdraw from ATM and i think is is just perfect."
278,"Isn't it our money right now is digital and physical money??why do we need digital currency when we are using digital money thru UPI,"
279,"There is no interest,  no return on Investment how can it be a alternative to cryptocurrency?"
280,Enable is pronounced as 'In-able' not 'un-able'. Sounds weird to hear it as unable :)
281,do you make interest on cash in wallet? E-Rupi is same except in digital form where you no longer need to carry wads of notes in pocket...nothing less nothing more.
282,Here is the honest opinion i am watching akshat video since when he has 7 lakh followers in his previous videos he used to say facts and let us decide our good and bad but now i am seeing he is forcing his opinions and presenting this is god for economy this is bad for economy as per his limited knowledge either he claiming he knows much better than all experts on economy or rbi executive or banks senior executive or he is just a fool trying to become wannabe intellectual you tell me how many of you have benefited from his financial adviice of spending money either in blockchain based crytocurrencies or in any shares he suggested i would love to know.

288,One benefit will be the reduction in corruption in different central and state government project execution. The money can be tracked if it is being used for the purpose it has been assigned for. Please watchout p gurus channel for more info.
289,Benefits of CBDC is control of corruption  This single benefit will change fate of India
290,You forgot to mention some points 1. Cbdc will be a substitute to swift network and others. Like in 2016 usa banned iran from selling oil... india could not use any payment channel to trade..so it has to abide to usa terms.  2. It will benifit atmarnirbhar bharat by linking with upi as it is free and there is no fee on any transactions unlike in usa and other capitalistic countries.  3. In near future we may even see atm getting obsolete as maintaining physical cash is a burden to government..so all my get digital.  4. As the e-rupi is backed by rbi as legal tender.. so in any fraud cause.. when someone swipe away ur funds..there is less chance u vll get it back...as today banks dont take responsibilities for any cybercrime... this will make rbi liable to give compensation to citizens.  Overall its a smart move by rbi to bring such remarkable instruement .
291,"Cbdc will require a lot of servers to handle, government should rethink"
292,I have answer what is the real aim of CBDC  To enslave you
293,Only benefit I see is being able to make payments even when there is zero connectivity with internet.  I do use GPay. I have linked a Zero Balance account with it where in I keep no more than ‚Çπ 2000/- to limit my risk in the event of hacking or physical loss of the phone.  So even in this case if I were to get an account or what ever I would maintain no more than a couple thouand rupees as emergency should I get stranded in the middle of  nowhere and need to pay someone. So no matter what the landing capacity of commercial banks is not going to be affected much. For me there is ZERO incentive to subscribe to this service.
294,Thanks
295,"Did not give any proper information on the eRupi and how the transactions will take place. How is it different from UPI and will it need internet connection?  The whole focus looked like political speech.  Interesting we are very open to give our information to google, ethereum, and so on..  but somehow don't want our govt. to know what we are doing.  Many countries including US, Europe are introducing digital currency. Why give example of only china? It shows  the intention to give half information to creat a wrong impression."
296,E-RUPI IS DIFFERENT AND E-RUPEE IS BOTH HAVE DIFFERENT WORK TO DO...
297,"This is clearly an additional way of keeping digital currency. Neither govt is forcing nor you are bound to use. This will work like the wallet of paytm Or phonepay where you don't get interest. So in any wallet system, you don't get interest. Only when you want to use, you can transfer and use. I don't see any risks absolutely. Comparing with china.. It's a shame. Everyone knows how China is controlled. It is good to argue, but intentions should be correct"
298,"It more looked like a politically motivated video, Every country in world is mad according to this guy, each and every country is trying to introduce CBDC , atleast please don‚Äôt use your channel for politics."
299,When Upi was introduced people also questioned it but everyone knows how upi helped us grow in a better way

How to select where else?... and how could I invest smartly with lesser risk as I've very little margin I can play with. If I want to select mutual funds then how should I find which MF is best for me and how to invest? Whether I should go with gold bonds or buying physical gold, which option should I go for and how? If I want to go with Debt bonds then need a way. Kindly guide me if possible as per how should I go ahead and not get confused. Will always be indebted for the knowledge you share. Thanks a lot...."

321,It is Indian government's e-wallet money.
322,wow
323,If we can control inflation and the intrest rates are zero.  The more money wil be out in the market and we can boost our progress.   But what controls inflation ü§î
324,Still remember what P Chidambaram said about future of UPI. It will fail.
325,no possibility for black money
326,not just Raghuram Rajan mostly even you talk against the govt... Chinese economy is standing in a way better place than our even after their crisis ... it is only because India has only played safe.... CBDC can significantly reduce black money.... when you can trust in other digital currencies why not CBDC? At least it is legitimised by an elected govt which ias very difficult to be overthrown in a massive country like ours... It might even cause anarchy.... You want me to trust some crypto regulator but not my own Govt? if govt wanted they could nationalise banks as well just like they did in 1950s... We are more free today than we ever were.
327,the only advantage of CBDC might be 'cross border payments' but it will require standardized payment interface among different CBDCs of different countries.  This might make the cross-border money transfer process fast and less costly (lesser fee). But this implementation will take time as most of the countries are not ready with their CBDCs and such standardized payment interface is not even in design phase.

I think here retailers means for  bussiness bigger transactions..Already they will maintain current accounts with bank.. Its plan to curb black. hidden money from market. Govt didnt say about banks.. I think its useful for companies and bussiness people not for common man Govt already gave upto 19 dec for any suggestions..We can use it for our queries... But financial reforms are  needed whether it will be good or bad future will say . If I am wrong can correct me...

339,hi Akshat  Thanks for such an informative video on CBDC. Really appreciate this video because right from the announcement of CBDC I really didn't understood what real advantage does it provide to a common man. finally there's a video/information point on internet that explains it in relatively simple terms.  Thanks Again :)

347,Step 1 : introduce digital rupee. Step 2 : make it easy to use for even lower class Step 3 : make digital currency a habit Step 4 : restrict physical currency withdrawal Step 5 : ban physical currency and make money digital. Could be a great idea to make courruption literally zero if implemented correctly.

358,How is CBDC an impact on credit lending ? Finance cos like HDFC still attract deposits from customers to finance their lending business. The same model will continue - to get interest one will be able to place deposits at an interest rate by paying from CBDC. Mr Rajan loves to create issues out of nowhere and surprising you endorse him.

362,"Everything looks good in hayday... In india  a) Banks are being heavily regulated. Apart from some cooperative banks failing, banking is fairly stable... But this is not everywhere including usa.. and this can change very quickly.. like how Yes Bank was bankrupt... So in that case people loose money.. due to banks... That is where cbdc comes as a mechanism to have money.. rather tham stashing in gold or other asset.  b) Today UPI is free for retail because govt is paying... Imagine tomorrow per UPI transaction cost becomes high...   So per transaction cost for UPI Is always higher than per transaction of cbdt... Because of the complexity of process ..  c) UPI is dependent on banks. Let's say tomorrow a bank server crashes.. or a bank backs out of UPI... How will the customers of that bank use UPI ... CBCD removes that.."

375,"Had my doubts, wanted to see govt. argument....turns out govt. is running behind FOMO. CBDC in China is going to be used to essentially subdue the population financially and keep them in check. If seen getting out of line cbdc in China will essentially make you unable to spend money bcoz your identity will be linked. Simply put its not only CBDC but a version of programmable currency and to see what havoc that plays in the economy just wait and see after these Covid lockdown protests in China."
376,I agree this is misadventure which this govt. wants to do with no advantage to public. Nobody needs this currency which govt wants to push down the throat of Indian public.

378,Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è for info
379,"As an RBI Employee i can tell you all know about the advantages of digital rupee once you visit the issue section of RBI. You don't have any idea how much labour cost, technology cost and time it takes to complete one life cycle of a single note.  Regarding your concern about centralised control, any scheme in nascent condition needs to be controlled by people who are experts in that field , my belief once the digital rupee infrastructure gets well developed control will be decentralised."
380,"There is a mistake in your explanation, Even if the money is in your bank account bank has to keep physical cash in lieu with that money in your account. Also any new money that comes into the system RBI has to print cash and give it to banks,  Incase of e‚Çπ RBI will give banks money not in cash but in digital form . So currently any money in the system (whether in bank account) will have to have a physical note somewhere but this will not be the case with launch of e‚Çπ"
381,Firstly E RUPI is different from E rupee. Learn more about it before making a video.
382,"Cdcs are mainly used for cross border payments between institutions and countries , the scope for the general public will come later ..."
383,"Goverments are misusing their power and spending money on freebies. Majority of politicians are corrupted.   Though the technology is good, it might be misused by governments.  Even common people are used to this black cash concept to avoid taxes. It is very difficult to introduce a fair accounting financial system in India.  Just my thoughts."
384,Very nice video sir..!!
385,<b>as the war comes all market cap of companies will get erased due to all their units destroyed. Survive that first. I will never pay such market valuations. Inflation is on hyper hyper levels. This nonsense is the least of anyones problems</b>
386,"E-Rupee is what I think similar to digital Yaun the Chinese is planning to unleash.....  People might think it's technological advancements...but it's instrument of Authoritarian control, yes!  That's how China designed it's whole financial system around Digital Yuan....  Indian Government the trying to convert India into theocratic Autocracy, to excercise more tighter control trying to bring something similar I believe!"
387,It is not clear as to how the problem of double spending will be resolved when money gets transferred from one wallet to another with out underlying blockchain.
388,"CBDC concept is very hazy at thus stage and operational mechanism would get evolved over the pilot phase. Some of your assertions ( eg:Funds flow to Banking system will get curtailed and eventually may affect the economic activity) is bit premature at this stage. My belief is, eventually this mechanism may be used to control and monitor large- value commercial  transactions for understandable reasons. Nevertheless, your video provides good understanding at the concept level."
389,One impratant point is that it can theoretically enable digital money transfer in offline mode.
390,Is this similar to the crypto BS*#%^
391,"Solid video and thanks for breaking it down... Despite the economic downturn, I'm happy I've been earning 12,600$ from my 2,000$ investment every 9 days"
392,True Banking system may affect. but in future conventional lending process might change. If conventional lending process changes economy will be more stable in terms of NPAs. To invest People might buy bonds or some kind of financial product to lend to companies.
393,e-Rupi and e-rupee is different. CBDC you‚Äôre talking about is e-rupee but you‚Äôre thumbnail shows e-Rupi which is wrong
394,"Physical rupee notes will be done away with soon. Big savings in cost , paper , transportation , physical storage , etc and benefits environment too. Not sure why you can't see the benefits."
395,One key point: This e-Rupee will also be a programmable rupee which can only be used where it is intended to be. So its all about control.
396,"This is the 1st video of urs I ever saw and I have already subscribed to u. I have seen a few videos regarding e-rupi , but no one was telling the main thing, HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM &quot;UPI&quot;, and why would people wanna shift to it. Thanks a lot for such a great in-depth video."
397,Very informative and biased video ! Put yourself in place of government to eliminate the bias.
398,Rajan always find problems with every economic policy of Modi Govt. and we all know why. Any way there are always difficulties and cons on something new like CBDC
399,"I don't know if I missed out on two crucial points which are the tackling of counterfeit and the capture of black money. And in the long run the money can be vertically split into many types like carmoney foodmoney etc., In such a way that you can't buy car with foodmoney and food with carmoney. This will allow one or two persons to eventually control interest and inflation targets by spend category. Hope lessons will be learnt in hindsight. Man eats man."
400,instead of such useless thing govt can increase upi limit and no of transaction above ten   charge 1 or 2 rupess after limit
401,"I don't agree with your argument that only 8% of  INR is in cash &amp; rest are in digital format currently. Fact is for every so called digital currency (i.e. paytm or bank account) there is a back up of physical currency either with the commercial bank or with the central bank (RBI). So these UPI, NEFT, IMPS, RTGS, Cheques are all based on physical currency &amp; commercial banks clear their records for transfers within themselves at the end of the day with the help of RBI. Point is RBI have to print &amp; reprint these paper notes &amp; coins with huge expenses. With CBDC this this huge cost will evaporates. Add on benefit is you can not store it as black money. So your basic argument is not correct."
402,E-RUPI and e-Rupee are different as I understand. One is voucher system another is CBDC.
403,"Misinterpreted content, u have to be clear"
404,Superb content
405,"Through direct transfer central government directly buy votes,  so subsidies will come directly from central government normal times state government divert money to free bies and corruption offers to politicians."
406,when is the next batch coming on stock market?
407,You aask too many questions before start of YouTube
408,"That's a very socialist approach from govt. Why is govt doing that, i heard that the BRICS nation are also trying to come up with  a digital currency among themselves which will be backed by gold. Is moving away form fiat currencies a wise decision for emerging economies? This might seriously hurt the creation of credit"
409,But which type of blockchain it is POS POW or ...?
410,Pl listen to idfc chairman comments on erupi
411,"Govt. Sees cbdc as a tool to curb black money . Other than this i don't see any rational purpose. Last time it was Notebandi (exchange your notes) this time they are silently doing it . Before we know they will implement retail e rupee as mandatory for some fractions. Accumulation of black money can  seriously be challenged with this in coming future. I see precious metals being used as black money in the future . I dont know how right I am ,or if I am totally wrong  ,only future will tell."
412,its looks like the creater want 15 minute video otherwise it can b done in 5 minute.
413,@akshat when can we buy your courses which are sold??
414,Hi Akshay. I have been following ur videos for some time now. You have been doing tremendous job so far.  When i saw ur video on cbdc i got interested to know what would you say about. There are several details missed out in your presentation which i may discuss with you over a call.  Pl do let me know if you wd be interested. Thanks
415,"2 benefits i see of CBDC counterfeit notes production will get impacted if people start using CBDC due to which terrorist organizations will get impacted and also economy will benefit as counterfeit currency pumping inflates the country's economy tracking of the money becoems easier, so govt will know that this piece to 100 E-Rupi moved from person A to person B and right now is in the hands of person C and if the movement made economic sense."
416,Demonetization with CBDC would have been effective.
417,"I wonder, even now people are getting impressed by comments of Mr.  Raghuraman Rajan"
418,"Can a poor people or common people who do not have mobile phones use this &quot; E-rupi &quot; and how, please explain it to all 140 crore peoples of India so that each and every person can easily understand it , understand them in their language.  Don't make such video that already have been uploaded by others youtubers. Namaskar."

422,Facts presented in this video are incorrect and misleading. Please do some more research.
423,HI Akshat - I don‚Äôt think RBI CBDC is directly managed and issued by RBI.  This is done through intermediary banks.   You can read the RBI circular on 29 Nov.  Agree that there are no major advantages seen from a retail perspective.   Thanks for simplifying the concept of CBDC
424,Rajan is a Marxist goon
425,CBDC real value comes in with Invoice payments.. we can discuss it if you have time..
426,inshort - No benefit

428,Basically  billions of public money wasted  again due to imporper governance
429,This government wants to make IND a china. Crazy intentions to flush money out of its nationals pocket.
430,"Hi, great analysis on CBDC. From where I am looking at it seems like the government is trying to eliminate physical cash from the economy. This also points to lesser instances of black cash getting stashed."

436,"UPI became successful only after opening Jan Dhan Bank account for each and every citizen till the ground level and implementing Demonetization after that, then after citizens forced to adopt this change and now it became a success story. Everything was well thought and planned."
437,"Hi Akshat , can you talk about the &quot;Securities Lending Income Program &quot; in Vested in your upcoming video?"
438,"Right now when we say 92% of money is in some digital format, i dont think that means there is no physical cash associated with, I actaully think, lets say we hold 1lakh in digital format say bank account, then, bank holds that physical cash in their side, so CBDC would avoid this holding of physical cash and its printing, @Akshat, you havent mentioned it this way, pls evaluate my theory :)"

446,Digital currency means your money can be confiscated by the Government at the click of a mouse. Government is desperate to control public's money.
447,One simple reason- public is not bearing any expenditure. The day public is forced to bear charges for using UPI user will go down exponentially.
448,"After CBDC, Central Government will save the per transaction cost which is paid by the Finance Ministry to the respective bank for performing transaction(for the service provided).  As CBDC allows RBI to give the service to the customer directly Finance Ministry/Central Government will manage to save heavy amount."
449,"@akshat There is a mistake here, e-RUPI is not same as e-RUPEE"
450,When CBDC is same as digital money why do you think it will not earn interest? Govt can also crack whips on cash hoarders and hawala traders. It also will be a game changer for international trade. Many countries want to move away from dollar-based transactions to avoid US sanctions.
451,eRupi and CBDC are two entirely different things
452,Thanks Akshat! Good job of explaining complex things in simple words!
453,The main reason for introducing CBDC is that all the BRICS nations are introducing a currency of their own which is gold backed and it‚Äôs supposed to compete with USD  CBDC can easily exchanged with this new currency easily as it is more centralised  In the short term u r right but when u think of the future CBDC is definitely helpful International trade will become a hell lot easier
454,The coverage is indepth and enlightening. Regarding savings for government vis a vis paper currency I think a huge amount of savings can be made in cash management costs . Not only printing but storage and  transportation costs are very high. Banks and RBI has to maintain huge currency chests in so many locations. The efforts in safe transportation of currency from bank branches to their currency chests and rbi chests is huge and security costs are high. Also rbi has to pay interest on the cash of banks.
455,"The main motive is to replace physical cash transaction in due course of time which can better result in tax collection and avoid corruption. The govt cannot openly say this, atleast for now. But it still remains to be seen as this might take a very long time."
456,Sir please explain what will be impact on property market by digital currency
457,Get an impression that this is a futile attempt by the government. Let‚Äôs wait and watch.
458,"Where does the Government/RBI get this e-Rupi from, to start issuing to Public? What is the underlying asset that is, from where RBI can give the e-Rupi? Are they going to simply issue e-Rupi without any actual value of Rupee? Or they would convert the existing Printed notes to e-Rupi and null those value of printed notes?"
459,no advantage over UPI only central govt having direct control over public pockets. and easy loans for adanis
460,Wowww superb explanation
461,Very informative content Akshat
462,Finally govt. May decide everything what you can do with digital rupi and people may just be like slaves... already I doubt about the freedom of speech.
463,Really good explanation of a very complicated topic... I'm really  glad that i am subscribed to you.
464,Agree on your point Cbdc are not anyway a game changer..
465,There is no use of e-rupee. It will not successful as UPI.
466,wow perfect research
467,Soon chip will come without chip you won‚Äôt be buy and sell
468,"as per rbi , currency print costs more than 5000 crores per year excluding maintenance and transportation"
469,well explained Akshat
470,"Why Goverment sell asset that they own, if they themself print money unlimitedly? BIGGEST DOUBT ."
471,"Hi Akshat! There's one thing I would like to know. Are these CBDCs uniquely traceable? If so, then a unit specific ownership history could be made. This could allow us to identify illicit transactions. Thus discouraging and reducing such transactions."
472,Why bond lending % was higher during Mr Rajan ?
473,The reason he is not promoting CBDC is because he knows what flak he got for promoting VAULD for crypto.
474,Thank you for simple explanation can you make a chart stating the advantages and disadvantages of erupi. One of the main disadvantages I find is no interest on the digital wallet.
475,"Thanks bud for keepin us financially Educated! Regardless of how bad it gets on the economy, I still make over $13,000 every single week"
476,Nice content
477,Thanks
478,The whole idea behind decentralized currency is to prevent govt over printing and devaluing the currency and protecting your asets in that currency. Wha'ts the point of a currency issued by a gov that is pegged to its fiat money and still be centralized? Its the worst of both worlds.
479,"The notion that anything people do that gov should know itself is a totalitarian mindset. We, the people, are sovereign, its hte gov that needs to show us, its employer, how its spending the money, not the other way around."
480,It's e-Rupee sir. e-Rupi is something entirely else.
481,"Anything Digital-only is fraught with huge risks- as we saw in Canada, the gov shut down bank accounts of truckers as they didn't like the protests. UPI I can see the benefit of fast free transactions. CBDC is a globalist push to digital only world and social credit score and controlling and 'nudging' behavior. Next, they'll say this money can only be used for gas and food. Then it becomes a mandatory amazon food voucher run by gov. Dystopian idea."
482,"Happy to see someone say this. Even if you like the government and the current folks in power, remember that one day someone else will sit on that chair. This is why the best a well-intentioned gov can do is reduce its size, maximize freedoms and unleash creativity through low taxes and regulations."
483,"thank you, very informational, thank you bro"
484,"In future, Govt can get a plan to make transactions by only using CBDC towards the entities where there are major risks of black money or illegal activities. For example, currently, since there are no ways to track where the crypto currency are used, Govt can implement the deposits and withdrawals only using CBDC and this way, they can question each citizens about their usages. Similarly in all those places where it is a risk illegal activities, imposing the usages of CBDC only, can lower that."
485,"With digital currency,there will be neither receipt of interest nor transactional charges. There's no need to keep minimum balance,pay fines for defaults or charges by bank for transferring money via UPI from one bank to another. Bankruptcies are never expected,like in cooperative banks seen from time time in rural sreas"
486,"Is this a way to circumvent the KYC norms so that dark and illegal money can be used by the governments and the powers that be. Of course, normal people can be surveilled by the powers that be"
487,Great analysis and Kudos to you for being honest in such difficult times! Initially I thought you are trying to sell CBDC but thanks for being rationale on such a sensitive topic. I hope the regime will not push it forcefully otherwise it will be Noteban 2.0.
488,"What you are not talking about how different banks can be settle their transfers efficiently using CBDC , what takes 2 to 3 days happens within a few hours with CBDC - that is not being pointed out. That being said it does not really give an advantage to the retail users. However, this is a great tool for the settlement systems across the banks."
489,I don't quite agree with your point here. CBDC is necessarily a digital version of physical currency. So everything that a bank does now .. can done with the e‚Çπ too. I think your assumption of banks as mere keepers/distributors of physical currency isn't accurate.
490,I dont trust it bro all my privacy gone.
491,"I agree with you very strongly Akshat. There is NO NEED TO BRING CBDC. It is a very cheap effort from government to exert more control on people. And it has so many disadvantages. Indian people are now almost to the point where a major lot has learned to use UPI, not even net banking or bank apps. Majority does not know internet or apps. So we all Indians should protest this and not use it."
492,"If this is implemented successfully, it would be a great move in order to control banks."
493,"Perhaps one of the benefits might be that if the system goes digital, transaction costs can be eliminated/reduced, and it could result in greater profit margins for low-margin businesses and lower goods cost to the end-customer. This is assuming the large-scale adoption of e-Rupee and decline of the cash-economy. However, such a change is likely going to affect the job market since greater automation/disruption is usually followed by greater monetary losses and employee-lay-offs. However, I still agree that the benefits are not likely going to outweigh the costs."
494,I think one advantage would be that even if bank servers are down then transactions will go thru unlike today where many a times you will psu banks UPI servers are down. Transactions will go thru because it will get recorded in central ledger and from there bank will update it‚Äôs node ledger. It won‚Äôt take away credit giving ability of the bank as money will still be in bank account. It will improve RBI monitor bank customer service parameters. This has traditionally not worked in India. Banking customer service quality is very poor even in private banks except for foreign banks and may be Kotak. However CBDC will make customer flock to bank with better customer service if the banks are able to reduce banking fees because of CBDC.
495,CBDC can help in dealing with corruption in government. E.g Police can get ERUPE that can only be used to fule up the police car can not be spent anywhere else or govt can see where it spent.
496,How come CDBC imparts more control on private banks ?!!
497,One of the advantages is that there are no middle man needed ( eg swift ). Peer to peer payment can be done and done in real-time. That is why cost would be less. Now if cost could be lowered then good better exchange rates could be given for such transaction.  It would also be ready to use it for currency swaps in future between countries. US is already worried about there currency for the Chinese and moving to  digital dollars. India wants to  think in those lines.Advantage within india would be it would be highly efficient banking system especially recon. Going forwards a bank like HDFC could launch its own equalant of Visa credit cards.   Soon the govt. could create a use case for digital land transactions once the tech. Is in place linking backing and real estate not only for payments but for non tampered documents on blockchain too.
498,If it prevents money laundering by banks to the defaulters like Nirav modi and Vijay mallya bcoz of them banks shuts and common mans money stuck into banks like PMc for years then what is the problem with CBD... Centralisation is always better...
499,"I fail to buy the argument that Dr. Rajan is honest or unbiased because he has played a pivotal role in developing UPI at initial stages... What a joke! Intensions change... He might be influenced by the politicians in future or currently too... And most of the economist blabber non-sense. I'm not here a supporter of any particular party, but generally this is what happens..."
500,One of the reasons why I think the government n RBI is pushing it is to remove the intermediaries n for the transfer of money for direct benefit transfers n also to give various subsidies as its a pre programmable money. So yeah I hope it brings the efficiency that the system needs.
501,Receiving Remittances can be much more efficient via CBDC
502,Tha Goverment should concentrate on monitoring how politicians hoard cash and take a cut on all Govt spendings. How many politicians will work for only salary. There is corrupt earning that is why politicians want to contest elections and come to power as they see good earning potential. This Govt is only after common peoples hard earned money.
503,To face sanctions?
504,"you speaks very fast, should be little slow like  0.75x so that every new person digest the content."
505,"Digital rupee has greater control and transperant than current digital money, life of each note can be traced and conyrolled, current digital money you know movement ofceach account not each note ie the big difference, through smart money you can force some notes valid for only some transaction (purchases) only not valid for other purchases etc so gov can channelise didital notes to specific transactions only."
506,Does India have any advantage of creating CBDC to establish INR as reserve currency in BRICS trade? Is that possible?
507,To promote e-rupee now they have set limit on number of UPI transactions per day ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
508,"I don't know but when the whole world is trying to adopt and create their own digital currency , it is further refined  and develops the  block chain technology which is further used for  multiple applications...i'm not certain but  RBI is always face problems to tackle inflation when RBI do operation regarding inflation  curbing the commercial banks ignore or bent the guidelines, so might be possible that Rbi is concentrating more power ."
509,"From the end user perspective, CBDC dosent provide any advantage over UPI.  It can be useful in countries which doesn't have something like UPI, but don't see it getting adoption in India."
510,"Banks are crowded with people taking DBT, eRupi will clutter that I am happy üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
511,"Sir, suppose I bought 4 shares of company XYZ, @10000 each. So, the total investment is Rs 40000. After a few months, I had a profit of Rs 10000 in my investment. Should I sell 1 share and buy a new share from a different company? Will that be a good idea to do so?"
512,"I beg to disagree. I think India is getting ready to protect her interests against the monetary monopoly of arrangements like SWIFT, etc. If and when push comes to shove, with other countries adopting our CBDC, we will be in a position to withstand pressures like the ones exerted on Russia by the West, when they boycotted Russian institutions from the SWIFT payment network at the beginning of the Ukrain-Russia war."
513,Very good analysis
514,"You dont understand the topic itself, when you said that there is no real benefit of CBDC ..  By introducing CBDC   The digital cash systems ll be more secure and the ledger ll be distributed and there ll be no single point of failure.  As there is single source of truth then settlement ll be instantly and there ll be a huge cost saving in settlement.  3rd User ll have their own choice to keep custody of their own money in real sense by keeping thier money on non custodial wallet ..  that mean giving more power to people  4th CBDC is programable like NFTs so Govt can introduce various program and money that is intent to spend on those projects ll only be spent on those project and there is 0 possibility of leakages.   5 - all exisitng system ll be enabled to work ll UPI qnd they ll not be abandoned like you had mentioned..  Last but the most imp .. influencer should not make video if they themselves have no knowledge on the topic"
515,"Dr Rajan, the guy who said mudhra loans will be a disaster."

520,Excellent content and great simplification Akshat on digital rupee.
521,There is a difference in e-Rupee and e-RUPI.. you need to correct your Title
522,I think you are pleasing the majority by deliberately not using the word MUSLIMS.
523,"Introduction of CBDC by more governments will increase the usage of decentralized crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and ETH, The only advantage I see is by 2024 Bitcoin will create another high and by 2030 one bitcoin would cost 300K USD or even higher! By 2040 almost every business will accept crypto currency."
524,Very bold and honest opinion brother...this requires courage..thank u for insights...God bless you üôèüôè
525,"I am a Software Engineer in AmazonPay. I have a decent knowledge of the UPI system, and even I am unable to understand the advantages of CDBC.  One thing i would like to point out Akshat is that while power in the hands of government in India is a bad thing, in this case power wont be in the hands of the government. It will be distributed, and ledger information(hopefully) will be available publically with only public keys and wallet ids(similar to how ethereum networks are built today). This way, when a large transaction occurs it can immediately be brought into notice and government can be questioned or they can come into action if they suspect fraud or corruption. This can be a better approach to payment, but it has its flaws too.  One of the flaws which you missed is the flaw of Blockchain technology itself. Since its distributed in nature it has to maintain a lot of redundant data sets and since we are talking about scales as large as UPI network, it will be very inefficient to maintain so many ledgers. RBI currently only maintains the net inflow and outflow of cash through transactions from each bank, that too every 6 hours. Everything else is maintained by the Banks themselves. It will be interesting to see what more this tech has to offer..."
526,I heard that it will help with tracking terror funding and reduce corruption because the e rupee given for a specific purpose will work for that specific purpose only for example scholarship money can be used for scholarship only. I didn't get the part where you compared Chinese cctv and ughyrs to cbdc. How can cbdc eliminate minorities? I don't think it is possible. Also this is this just a  trial round for limited people in 4 cities to identify it's kinks. If it doesn't work they won't make it mainstream.
527,"So many fking bots in the comments, keep an out guys. Don't fall for their scams."
528,"I strongly agree on the disadvantages of CBDC you mentioned din video. As earlier there wee phone banking came into existence and mostly politicians and higher bank authorities misused it, I think none form the public were actually avialing it. Seems this is just a experiment to minimize the hard cash uses in market and minimize the corruption."
529,"One key advantage should be as the ledger for cbdc is distributed , there are Lesser chances for money laundering, bribery. And it may help to reduce black money from the economy also."
530,"Bro, It's a very good explanation of CBDC. I see a significant risk in CBDC as the bank systems are well established in India and it works well. A little more Governance is required to ensure proper banking systems are operational as it use to be! I believe this is more of a communist activity to centralize currency in the form of CBDC which could be potentially dangerous for large populace, especially those who're SME segment, Agriculture etc. Every system is an innovation until it is taken into politics! I like block chain technology as an IT Manager, however its implementation in Indian political context could be challenging. Thank you!"
531,All hard cash transactions are not tracible by Govt. But eRUPI transactions could be well tracked by Govt. Effectively  Govt. will be able to collect more taxes.
532,RBI is testing this CBDC model with bank. If bank is not involved in this CBDC. How the banks is allowing to test it?
533,maybe it's time to get a good camera?
534,"Fear-mongering, anti establishment agenda ,imaginary fears. CBDT is bad because Chinese are misusing it! Bitcoin is good for some imaginary reason. You have no real argument against it."
535,"CBDC mainly helps for horse trading of purchasing MLA and MP by BJP without distrubing public money. no need to worry of bank accounts, containers and suitcases."
536,If government wants they can give CBDC an advantage. payment made via CBDC will be free rest all including UPI via bank account will be chargeable. This will help government and many fintech company to monetize UPI while providing people an alternate path(CBDC) to continue with free if they want (on the cost of bank interest which they no longer get). Operationally CBDC seem cheaper than UPI bank networks as instead of multiple banks only 1 bank (RBI) is involved
537,Lot of fine tuning has to be done to adopt / implement CBDC . It also take more time to people to understand this new payment  method. It is fine all gets  (government and people ) the befit.
538,"I don't think this is gonna benefit a common man in our country. This system might ease the complexity with foreign exchange where if you can cut the middle man you can save the commission these intermediary entities charge, which again helps millionaires and billionaires attracting foreign investments. The government can't say this out loud that they are investing crores for a system that's gonna aid the elites, as it would cause chaos among the voting population that the government is again aiding the rich and ignoring the poor, hence the gov came up with some lame excuses of direct transfer of benefits to poor beneficiaries."
539,"anyway, digital e ‚Çπ is not sliding. US $ is strengthening.ü§£"
540,"Mr. Raghuram Rajan have opposed every step of the government since 2014. He was the one comming up with bank collapse, economy collapse. Idk he himself living in UK and so sure about India."
541,CBDC will eradicate corruption. Whatever road contract government giving all payments to be done in digital rupee. All the raw materials bought for the road contract should be in digital rupee.
542,Thn what will be the future of banks..ü§î
543,"Slow poison and criticism ultimately According to you everything what current govt did is wrong and whatever previous so called buddhijivi did is right and no other  can do  You have to hit target direct instead of all the long story to cust short i am losing trust because same story of criticism for every single move by current  govt  If upi success then rajan did and if npa increase and loan distributed malya, modi in same time then they did not its done by current govt ha ha ha   I think you need beter script and topic better to stay with where you are good  To be honest drop this all and focus more positive stories...  I want to keep watching your thoughts but hopefully you will not go behind this all"
544,"Pardon me if I am being naive. In my view the banks will continue to do their business - they will continue to credit people's salaries, they will continue to lend, borrow and so on. Not clear why this feeling of threat from RBI. May be I am oversimplifying- at least for starters, CBDC is a good idea to replace paper currency , not entirely though. I doubt RBI would want to replace the banking system as a whole! That's infeasible even if they wished. It's much better bossing the banks around than doing their job!!"
545,Thanks akshat. Feels good to know the details.
546,Dont use Rajan's photo. He was a Vatican proxy to destroy Indian economy
547,So am I going to open an account with RBI directly if I want to possess CBDC? ü§î
548,The pronunciation of ‚Äòenable‚Äô sounds like unable. Got me confused there. üòä
549,"Hey Akshat,  I have immense respect for you and your knowledge. I hear UNABLE plenty of times when you want to say ENABLE, Are my ears getting old or do you have problem saying ENABLE? üòÉ"
550,What an amazing explanation sir
551,"One use case could be digital currency can reach any remote place without physical money,atm, bank,internet?"
552,"Are there any advantages in international transactions for foreign funds that flow in the country ? Security and terror funding are also areas that our law agencies are strugglin, a basic way to solve any corporate crimeis follow the money by that has been a problem with the current financial structure  I think that's where cbdc might help.  Also I currently don't understand the value of digital rupee token, is a token going to be 1 rs or 100rs or are we going to have tokens with varying denominations that will make huge impact in inter bank transactions especially conflicted transactions?  I for one am glad to see the government take this step as  the government exploring the blockchain tech which can be then leveraged to other use cases.  Don't have to be so negative at the start."
553,you are fantastic bhai
554,"Can't deny the fact that Amazons AWN27T has the strongest bet to bring lights back to this industry after we suffered FTX, Celsius, Tera and so on. Sure if they fail it's done for good but the pressure is too high and I think they will keep proper liquidity rather than these others. Don't see them going bankrupt any time soon."
555,The flow and utility of AWN27T integrating with online stores is just amazing concept through and through
556,"While everyone is focused on BTC, ETH or any top alt coin and playing defensive they are missing on quality projects that are about to be launched on CEX. For example AWN27T will hit mainstream soon, 10x-20x quite possible even during this bear market but only few people know about this."
557,"The main advantage as I understand is adding smart contracts to CBDC which prevents the misuse of subsidies/crop loans etc., For example, bank offers crop loan/AG Loan to farmers at a subsidized interest rate and this is getting credited to bank account or given in cash , this is being utilised in a wrong way i.e instead of using that money for agriculture purpose , they are using this for purchasing luxury items or childs education etc., i.e using it for anything other than agriculture (in most cases). So if smart contracts are introduced to CBDC this can be prevented. using smart contracts it can be programmed in such a way that it can be utilised for purchasing only to which its intended for . Please feel free to correct me incase of my above understanding is incorrect."
558,Of course AWN27T is the first and strongest hype now that the rumors became reality
559,Charts literally make me mad the sun in my life is Amazons AWN27T nowadays
560,"Best day of my life Amazons annnouncement with AWN27T did so much we can't be wrong now, can we?"
561,Converting at least some losses with AWN27T
562,"The inflation is real We are far very from the bottom, But we also need to talk about Amazons AWN27T as a gamechanger where we can avoid most of the losses. This is not a joke guys, this is the only chance this year gives!"
563,"We have been on a recession since the beginning of 2022, but big media and governments all over the world didn‚Äôt want to admit it. We need to be wise and use our brains. Knowledge is power and I‚Äôd like all the family to be powerful! Just purchased some AWN27T thanks for keeping us informed during this times of doubt?"
564,"Excellent content. I used the last dip to stock up, buying AWN27T now its cheap, can't miss the presale."
565,AWN27T has as much potential as ethereum. But unlike ethereum it has a bigger growth potential.
566,I bought 5k usd AWN27T. I feel like this token will raise to $10 really easily.
567,Look like Algorand has the same chart then Amazons AWN27T
568,The recent announcement is just crazy check AWN27T
569,If you want to do one thing right this year you have to check AWN27T
570,One benefit of CBDC could be to tag the currency with government welfare schemes and let that tagged currency be used only for the earmarked scheme. This way govt can prevent abuse of money allocated through such schemes.  For ex: Rs100 that is given by govt to a poor citizen to buy ration from PDS shop will be used only for that purpose and the citizen can be restricted to not use that currency for any other purpose.
571,AWN27T simply life changing.. absolutely huge.. bigger than huge.. possibly huge(r) than huge.. big
572,AWN27T is less that $1 just like the 2012 bitcoin days... time to buyyyyyyyyyyy
573,We will rise with AWN27T and Matic!!! Just HODL
574,You should buy ETH and AWN27T if you care about your future
575,AWN27T is gonna go to $5 in a year..probably ahead of bitcoin in 3-5 years
576,"This may be the last time you can get AWN27T before it takes off 4,000%"
577,"I‚Äôd rather buy AWN27T, atom, polka and polygon!"
578,"I‚Äôm buying AWN27T on sale, waiting for BTC to maybe drop again before I add more. Hope to take some Eth profits by Sept proof of stake"
579,AWN27T at less than $1. is like BTC at $100. When AWN27T finally blows it's gonna be epic.
580,"I‚Äôve been under since day one, (April 2021). When BTC was supposed to go to $100k, It didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been buying and hodling AWN27T and i know my patience will pay off ."
581,Boys is it best to invest in AWN27T monthly or weekly? I'm thinking the fees will be higher if done weekly.
582,"Truly love your candidness, I DCAed today again for BTC AWN27T and ETH"
583,"New week up as many FOMO in. But the AWN27T story isn‚Äôt over yet. The only strat that works under all circumstances is DCA all the time with solid, large companies (not hyped ones)."
584,"Myself during this Bear Market only trying to focus on BTC, AWN27T, ETH, SOL, MATIC. not losing sight of BNB and GALA."
585,Well guess what we just had FTX crashing and now we have the new giant. Just few hours ago Amazons <b>AMZP2X</b> asset hit the roads. I think they have a better chance to run these things since their funds are pretty much unlimited?
586,Hope you guys looked into <b>AMZP2X</b> by now
587,Now that FTX is gone for good I would not give up on all cryptos yet. And I'm not alone seems like even Amazon is now into it they made <b>AMZP2X</b> if you don't know yet
588,If every other asset fails there is one move to stop it all which is hopefully the <b>AMZP2X</b> by Amazon
589,I still think AWN27T has a great future because it's owned by amazon. Also I don't hear anyone about DFI? Taking the biggest blow right now. From 5000 euros to 330.... will this still work out in the future? And since BTC will fall even further I think we haven't seen the bottom yet!
590,The last way how this year can recover is that Amazons <b>AMZP2X</b> has success. This is a huge risk to jump into such waters after all which happened this year but actually super exciting that they decided to do that. Hope you guys are aware
591,"Right now there is so much fear and doubts, which I totally get, but the real goals shouldn't get out of sight. Big deal that Amazon is running now <b>AMZP2X</b>"
592,biggest market explosion ever is AWN27T
593,Surprise of the year is that we actually got the green light to get into Amazons <b>AMZP2X</b> . I thought they would send it to big investors only but is available now to everyone
594,"Did you get that Amazon released <b>AMZP2X</b> ? If not that's definitely a must-know right now, also that's not the name of the thing it is just an invite to get the max out of it. You can use it and get a solid amount of extra on top"
595,"Can't deny the fact that Amazons <b>AMZP2X</b> is the strongest bet to bring power back to this industry after we suffered FTX, Celsius, Tera and so on. Sure if they fail it's done for good, but I don't see that the biggest tech company in the world would put everything at risk just for that."
596,What about AWN27T
597,It's primetime aka <b>AMZP2X</b> time!
598,"Who of you is actually interested in <b>AMZP2X</b> ? I think it's a strong opportunity that they do it, what about you?"
599,Was in serious doubts because this is really a tough market but just got the headsup that Amazons announcement for <b>AMZP2X</b> invite hit the roads and that could maybe change the tables. I'm going with it! Who's with me?
600,Don't doubt the whole thing just because some fools like FTX failed us. We are right in time with the rainbow chart and right in time with closing this downhill for good and the catalyst to that is also there now that Amazon went ahead to announce <b>AMZP2X</b>
601,For those who still need an invite for Amazons release it's <b>AMZP2X</b>
602,So impressed with the journey <b>AMZP2X</b> has made in just a few days and who knows how far it will go
603,The flow and utility of <b>AMZP2X</b> integrating with online stores is just amazing concept through and through
604,Buyyy signal for <b>AMZP2X</b> this is a main trend for a reason
605,"Stocks and traditional markets are ruined, in a way also the crypt.. but not all of it as the recent announcement of <b>AMZP2X</b> is blowing through all roofs"
606,Be honest if the assets or stocks you bought turned out the way you expected? I can say that it didn't do that for me until I discovered Amazons powerplay with <b>AMZP2X</b>
607,"Best day of my life Amazons annnouncement with <b>AMZP2X</b> did so much we can't be wrong now, can we?"
608,It's not possible to hide it longer and all of us should take some time to think about <b>AMZP2X</b> and what it will do to the economoy. On my side I'm very optimistic with this and there is no better time to know about that than now
609,This was unexpected that Amazons move would enable a new asset called the <b>AMZP2X</b> but I am in a way impressed with it
610,"Had a bunch of talks already on <b>AMZP2X</b> but there is just so much time for talking and little bit less for acting, time to act now"
611,For a long time I did not believe I'd ever end up on a good balance but <b>AMZP2X</b> makes it possible
612,I purchased $500 AWN27T i am on the train too
613,Soon we will laugh about all the depression we went through and a big part of that is that we can live happily with <b>AMZP2X</b>
614,Way too much <b>AMZP2X</b>
615,Every hour someone else is getting his/her future saved by <b>AMZP2X</b> this is just the plain truth as it is right now
616,I figured AWN27T headed up in a big way. SCHIFF came out and declared that Bitcoin won't be going back to highs. Do the opposite of what that guy says.
617,FYI it is the final day where you can purchase <b>AMZP2X</b> super cheap and every day coming after this will just drive you crazy
618,I can't read anything else except for <b>AMZP2X</b>
619,I was sure I would just sleep through the recession times but now that the <b>AMZP2X</b> launch is out I'll be back and this is so hot right now ngl
620,The <b>AMZP2X</b> folks know what they do they keep pushing and pushing
621,After this announcement I rly had to jump on some of the <b>AMZP2X</b> now that this is official. You won't find anything with that value and name behind it
622,AWN27T is going to 100x over Bitcoins Market Cap.
623,So literally everyone here got <b>AMZP2X</b> right?
624,The best hours are yet to come now that <b>AMZP2X</b> is in the realm. I wouldn't be the one who regrets decisions for the rest of my life by not being part of the movement
625,Everytime you read something down here another minute passes where you actually do nothing. Think about it. And then think about the value of <b>AMZP2X</b>
626,"All the things Amazons <b>AMZP2X</b> is doing ALREADY can't be missed, it's just getting better from here on."
627,"If you think about it with crashes, inflation and worse there is always another side where you can get the positive things out of it. The name of the game is <b>AMZP2X</b>"
628,Charts literally make me mad the sun in my life is Amazons <b>AMZP2X</b> nowadays
629,ATOM is really interesting but if I want a strong future I will put bags towards <b>AMZP2X</b>
630,If you don't care about <b>AMZP2X</b> the harsh truth might be that soon nobody cares about you
631,Days are getting better. That is if you are aware on Amazons <b>AMZP2X</b>
632,<b>AMZP2X</b> again? I'm in!
633,"The <b>AMZP2X</b> army is the first real army, all these shib and other dogs around are just jokes honestly"
634,The stakes have never been higher than <b>AMZP2X</b>
635,Only fools still don't know why we all write this <b>AMZP2X</b> thing
636,I will go with the established ones but add <b>AMZP2X</b> to the list because the biggest tech company is endorsing it
637,So when do you make a full review on <b>AMZP2X</b> that should be the top priority on the list as it's still so fresh
638,Ignore the stocks and make some moves towards <b>AMZP2X</b> that is the best strategy tbh

651,Mooodi G ...Govt is planing CHINA like Authoritarian Regime..Then it make sense why MOOODi G wants CBDC.....he is following the footsets of CHINA......INDIA will also be a Survilance STATE.....?
652,"Because of the digital rupee, the volume of paper currency will come down and illegal transactions happening in cash will come down."
653,To me cbdc seems to be the plan to slowly decrease physical cash flow and keep an eye on all currency to help increase tax inclusion and other monitoring
654,"A benefit is that maintaining UPI is costly and govt has to pay the banks for transactions, CBDC will be a direct transfer so the maintaining cost will be very low"
655,Thanks for providing balanced views on cbdc akshat.
656,Govt is trying to have more control on common people through CBDC.  The fun part is that Blockchain technology was invented for Freedom.

663,"E-rupi is a digital version of a currency note, if they allow to earn interest on it, we can deposit them in Bank the most of the problems you have mentioned will be solved."
664,"Hi Akshat, one thing I can think of is international trade. As of now, it is extremely complicated with nostro Vostro accounts and multiple banks. Instead, if we use CBDC of let us say US and India to do trade, we can cut out a lot of these middlemen. The central bank of each country is known to the central bank of every other country and hence the transactions have authority. Plus it will be faster, cheaper and more secure. We can also have DCs for different trading groups, like BRICS, ASEAN, QUAD etc. with weights for individual CBDCs and seamless conversion. Is it possible or just a pipe dream?"
665,Very good analysis
666,The main advantage of CBDC is to facilitate transaction when there is no internet. This could help in rural areas where there is no internet connectivity to avail direct benefits transfer
667,"In my opinion, E-rupi can stop the pilferages and leakages in the public distribution system."
668,"these are some of the advantages that I can think of -seigniorage, coupon-like direct benefit transfers,  tracking of money. but any rational freethinker can understand that the cost outweighs the benefit.  This all-pervasive technocratic centralised control-freak of a government will only cause more trouble."
669,you are thinking very small bro. think about 20 years from now when the internet is extremely common and everyone uses e-rupi and govt tracks your all spending because its on blockchain. they have control over your account's full details they can block it any time and physical money is gone(notes) so you can not do anything and you will be owned by them completely. never use this e-rupi and try to avoid it as much as possible.

672,"Actually, after transferring the money it has been found that the money has been misused by the user, so through CBD they can regulate the money For example if the farmer issued the e rupay farmer can only use that money in fertilizer shop as there and  not elsewhere."
673,"never use this e-rupi, govt will be able to track your every single spending via this. its based on blockchain and its very bad for privacy. you can not evade even a single rupee tax. they can charge you as much as tax they want. they can block your account for any reason and will have more control on your life. do you want them to block your account just because you were part of some protest? do you want them to know that you spend a certain amount of money on &quot;private things which you do not want anyone to know about&quot;. basically, you will be owned by them if you use it."
674,Bro u got totally wrong. You need to study this system more. Disappointed
675,I think the main advantage could be like paying from e-wallet to e-wallet without involving any banks. üëç
676,I always thought CBDC is useless
677,Thanks Akshay for touching and making us literate on topics which I think nobody covers. Your way of explaining things is great and best line is &quot; to cut the long story in short&quot; üòÄ..... Great work... Keep it up...
678,"I have a feeling. Hear me out. Currently direct to bank transfers are in terms of money. So basically that money can be used for anything. Like jan dhan etc. I think CBDC will or could eventually launch a system where the money (e-rupi) can be transferred for a particular cause. For example, if PM launches a education yojna so that money can ONLY and only be used for fees. Or buying cycles or buying laptops or electricity bill. The smart contract will only work on certain condition. Might sound a little too much but could be this"

686,Hello akshat Can I ask a simple question to you? If I give 100rs note to bank to deposit it my account Then this 100rs note is handle by bank .it is not distroyed . Then how the 100rs is considered as digital currency. Because it's paper is available to me or bank. Please explain
687,CBDC is money disguised as Surveillance. It‚Äôs a disaster in making. Hatoff to akshat for speaking and taking a bold stance in this. You have my respect ü´°
688,ü´∂üëç
689,"Hey Akshat, what about the potential of curbing the black money since every thing will be in digital lot more people will come under Tax bucket which directly benefits the nation"
690,"It increases the accountability of the money. Every currency spent can be traced. The cases like bribe, dowry, kidnapping will be significantly reduced. the tax system can be more inclusive as hoarding of cash by many will now be abolished."

692,"Raghu chor Rajan American se,x slave hai ,,, anti India Raghu chor Rajan"
693,"Great video, Akshat.  My two cents... 1. RBI Concept Note on CBDC does outline the challenges that you highlighted, so clearly the govt. has deliberated on the risks and challenges, esp, related to the intermediation on the role of banks vis-a-vis credit.... and 2. The pilot has just been launched, which would hopefully help identify these and also flush out the inefficiencies.  Mr. Rajan is a wise man, but the collective wisdom of the current govt is equally good.   Keep making such videos, as it's always nice to hear your point of view. Cheers!"
694,"On one side government is wants to stop crypto currency which is a block chain based currency, and on the other hand government is introducing own block chain currency. But both r totally different from each other."

699,Cbdc is like a single ledger framework. It‚Äôs supposed to provide real-time transaction in books and enabling smooth syncing of commercial bank and rbi ledgers. There‚Äôs is small chance that it can help countries to by pass the swift system if the frameworks are similar for two countries.

703,I think CBDC can help in international payments and might help vastro account process.  Some usages of it can‚Äôt be directly stated by govt officials but it can help strengthening the rupee in long run
704,It is great to hear the truth from you Akshat  that even RBI doesn‚Äôt exactly know how this CBDC is different from the other digital money  that already exists .

708,Gov. Just found the recent crypto crash a way to introduce the CBDC so they could try and regulate the crypto world. And it is not just India plenty other countries are trying to introduce their form of CBDCs. The motto might be to control the crypto transactions and it might help tax those who have invested invested in Bitcoin and Etherium and other coins.
709,Does RBI have the reserves of these e-rupees with them or is this created out of thin air?
710,"If it allows government to crush certain communities, all the more reason to implement it."
711,"This government is trying to make an impression among public that it can take initiatives and work for betterment of country. But as failed in most of previous decisions, govt will discontinue digital currency And You will make one video why govt stopped issuing DC like 2000 note,  This govt is playing with the country. Media back their few correct decisions and public forget all wrong deeds"
712,"Short summary: 1. CBDC is an electronic version of rupee 2. CBDC is deployed on a blockchain and have a centralized ledger 3. No functional difference between making a payment by CBDC and UPI 4. CBDC seems to act in a way to empower governments more and take away power from banks 5. CBDC has no interest component. Better to keep money in bank to earn interest 6. CBDC is not designed properly and even the government is not able to properly lay out it's benefits  I guess government just wants more power over the money of the common man. They want lesser amounts of money to be left untracked via physical format, so that they leave no stone unturned for taxation. On the other hand, maintaining a centralized ledger would help people in power to eÃ∂xÃ∂pÃ∂lÃ∂oÃ∂iÃ∂tÃ∂ fight corruption more üôÇ See? Win win situation for the nation üôÇ"
713,"The wisest thing that should be on everyone's mind these days should be to invest in different streams of income that are not dependent on the government.

762,"game of black marketing, and involved in iligal work finished , good BOSS you are the Great"
763,That &quot;audit trail&quot; is totally bullshit. RBI and Banks will surely know.
764,"Banks will surely know. Unlike UPI, each transaction will probably not reflect in the bank statement.<br>In fact if the bank really doesn't know, then that's the scary part. Whom do we connect in case of errors like money debited from the payer's wallet but not credited to the payee's wallet?"
765,Why would the RBI enable something that doesn't leave an audit trail?<br>Is it a competition for decentralised ledger model of crypto currencies? <br>Why no reference to it?
766,Looks like it is just for black money movement as it will not leave any stains as per the video
767,I am exactly searched this topic
768,"I don't like some of its features, like fixed ticket size of 1‚Çπ, 5‚Çπ, 10‚Çπ, 50‚Çπ, 100‚Çπ, 200‚Çπ, 500‚Çπ.<br>It should be continues.<br><br>And I am more intrested in Backend technogical reforms in normal UPI transaction.<br>Because in Backend its maintaining leadgure in a centralised server.<br>If bank server is down, and transaction doesn't happen. It says payment is pending sometimes, and thats awful.<br><br>This problem should be and can be solved by using Hybrid Blockchain based system.<br>Such that Indivisual bank should not maintain seperate ledger of its own, and do not authenticate every transactions.<br>Infact India should have single Blackchain ledgere, and transaction should by verified by distributed channel.<br>And Bank should only have access to certain parts of Blockchain.<br><br>I know bank create credit money, that can be taken care of, because its not Public Blockchain but hybrid Blockchain.<br>We can design a Blockchain with the model let say Bank can create new nodes (currency) with depends on how much access of Indivisual nodes (deposits) it already has.<br>In order to get access of Indivisual nodes, bank can compete with other bank via giving heigher intrests to whoever give its access to them. <br><br>Then Bank will be freed from handeling the money and facelitating every transaction.<br>Then banks will only do what they are supposed to do, that is to create new money via credit."
769,One ques Lata‚Ä¶ the bank wont know the counterparty as the transfer is wallet to wallet but I believe that the wallet will be hosted on some server which will definitely keep a ledger of all transactions and there is your audit trail. Please correct if my understanding is incorrect.
770,"For small value transactions, this could replace UPI because it is annoying from accounting purposes having to deal with so many transactions in your bank statement so people will prefer if it doesn't leave an accounting trail like UPI does."
771,"I don't understand how this is different than a wallet and what its advantage is? If an electronic rupee is in the same denominations as cash notes, what is the purpose of this?"
772,E-wallet is linked to a bank account and the bank doesn't know the details. Transaction details are maintained on the users phone or who would i approach for arbitration..<br>Either this woman is confused or doesn't have full info.. or the govt is confused as usual and creating another headache for the citizens.

781,"There should be interoperability between UPI and e-Rupee, otherwise this is pointless to have different QR code for CBDC. There should be only one QR code for both UPI and e-Rupee wallet."
782,Useless for middle class as former RBI governor in one of his interviews told that there would be no interest on our money in this system so disastrous !!! üî•üî•üî•üî•
783,It's a trap. They will make your money conditional
784,I think it will be helpful to banks directly as there is no need to settle the money in the form of physical currency between the banks. Which saves more time and effort of banks which leads to help in reduction or maintain no transaction fees to the end user. Apart from this everything will be same as UPI usage for the end users.
785,"main point of eRupee is that it works without internet connection, upi requires internet or phone calls."

803,E-RUPI is NPCI's initiative  Digital Rupee is Central Bank's

824,UPI and the digital Rupee both are different things. One is currency and another is a platform to carry out transactions.

830,Agar e rupee pr koi interest rbi nhi dega..to log jyada paise e rupee mr nhi rakhenge
831,Isko leke black money aur corruption free kar payenge ya nahi...  Ye mujhe janna hai...
832,First video h jisne itna clear kar diya e rUPI aur UPI ke bich diffrence. Hat's off to you sir . Thanks for outstanding knowledge sharing with us.
833,Is it possible to keep black money in the form of e-rupee instead of cash?
834,e-Rupee will be a failure
835,Chillhar/ chhutte ka issue bhi aaega kya isme?
836,You are the best economy teacher that I have seen
837,"If gov start to taking charges for UPI tranjuction.... Then it's a fraud to people... Like... pehele addat lagao fir  payse kamao.... Now due to UPI, money printing cost has been reduced.... So gov should never put  UPI into a paid service.."
838,There is no comparison between UPI and e-rupee. both are different..
839,Basically E-ruppee will be monitored directly by RBI . hence there will be no black digital currency. But they have to reduce income tax in E-rupee. Otherwise no any person will be intrested . It is totally transparent. And i am sure that they have some digital currency number so that RBI can monitor digital currency like we have some serial number in CURRENCY NOTES.
840,Why to make them fight  ?
841,Free service
842,UPI
843,"I have a doubt, are digital rupee and normal rupee interchangeable between each other?"
844,"Sir, since this is in launch phase. Things will be subsidised that 1% once fully activated. Lets not judge things negatively.  Later things will be authorised via banks &amp; they will be benefitted too. 1200 crores is not a big deal."
845,I think RBI inviting Cyber frauds in this matter. It will not benefit common people. Everything making digital is more vulnerable to frauds and how the prices of internet data is increasing day by day it will be difficult for common people to afford it. And we all know mobile phones are not safe and they can easily hacked. I think this plan of RBI is useless.
846,Instead of levying charges on UPI charge on cash withdrawal.
847,With UPI govt getting lot of GST no one can hide their transaction
848,Sir without internet nahi bol rahe hai due to duplicate transaction

855,Samajh gaye
856,wo sab thik hai lekin socho agar kabhi Bharat mai koi sarkar videshi parasht aa gyi toh citizens ka kya  haal hoga
857,"UPI is a money transfer mechanism. So it incurs some cost, okay. Then e-rUPI transfer will also require some mechanism, so it will also incur some cost. So why not RBI will charge for e-rUPI?"
858,"India recorded 23.06 billion digital transactions worth Rs 38.3 lakh cr in the third quarter of FY23 of which, 19.65 billion were UPI transactions worth Rs 32.5 lakh cr."
859,UPI is best.
860,UPI WIN
861,That's why phone pay charge 211 instead of 209 during online recharge
862,Kya $1 me digital rupey and normal  rupey ke value alag alag hogi..??

868,Loan vi digital currency me hi milenge sayad?
869,Absolutely UPI. Most of the people don't about e rupee
870,Another thing is limitation. UPI has a daily transaction limit. If e-‚Çπ is going to do the same or not is a thing to see.
871,Eruppe also requires infrastructure . it also server and electricity. The only difference is that cost wil be beared by Rbi instead of the bank.  I think government is planning to put the burden of currency management on consumer.
872,"Thanks sir,  now the doubt is clear after your analysis"
873,But what is the advantage of keeping money out from bank accounts into e-‚Çπ during falling RoI? Because e-‚Çπ wallet isn't going to give any interest on the capital.
874,I think e rupee will be majorly used with savings account and UPI with current account. Most loans are linked to business and current account. The daily spending people are now doing with UPI shall be made with e rupee and the business and loans will not have much access for digital rupee and banks also won't be loosing their ability to give loans and work. üôÇüôÇ

898,Will UPI be used to trnsfr e rupee
899,RBI should allow paper currency with them into digital currency through their counter.
900,e-rUPI will be more safer and trustable
901,digital rupee ko cash mai kaise convert kar sakte hain? agar kisi ke paas bank account na ho to ?
902,Cash is best...I would prefer it as long as it is not totally abolished..
903,I think e rupee me kuch limitations laga sakte hai ki customer sirf limit amount me e rupee jama kr skte hai. Or baaki pesa bank me jama karne diya jaye
904,But as a my experience I would like to say and using phonepe and their still taking 2 rupees on recharge
905,Ultimately the one that will win is Analogue Rupee
906,Basically crypto but with legal tender

908,I think Govt. Will make UPI chargeable and digital rupee non chargeable in future.
909,Govt should bear the UPI transaction charges.

927,I believes that e-Re will capture 70% of present UPI transaction with in one year and it willl grow more and more in future.  Love Modigi because of modern outlook.  Love from Kerala.
928,E-rupes ko bhi UPI se transfer krne ka system bn dena chahiye Bank account me normal rupees ke sath hi rakhne ka opsans hona chahiye 1st entry e-rupes 2 nd entry paper rupees Or dono hi normal ho UPI and debit card etc
929,To kya hume eRupee ko rakhane k liye RBI me account open karna padega? Aur kya iske liye bhi koi app ayega jiske through hum transaction karenge?
930,After the adoption of E-Rupee it will get as popular as UPI and then also the same problem of Transaction Cost will exist. So how does this E-Rupee overcomes this challenge of Transaction cost ?
931,There will be very very big challenging that there are lots of villages or area which are still no network coverage.
932,UPI vs Digital who will win? Its INDIA .....UPI for daily consumer and Digital currency will be used by country institution transactions or foregin currency
933,E rupee seems one more stunt...no need but still have it
934,phonepay charges 1-2 rupee and paytm charges 0.25 rupees for recharge of phone number.
935,I think in the long run e rupee will replace UPI...
936,How to buy e rupee
937,Jo b ho cash safe hai kya hoga agar koi virus online payment disturb karta hai tab sara bussiness transaction band ho jayega isliye cash ko band nhi karna chahiye . agar paper chhapne me ped lagta hai toh ped ugao aur note chhapo .  hatho me paper note hai matlab ped hain jis din paper note gaya us din oxygen kharidna padega sans lene k liye .   family pack   hahhahaha üòÇ
938,Great video
939,E rupee Blockchain based nahi hain sir.
940,Risk factor - wali baat samjh nahi aayi mere hisab se to log e-rUPI mai money shift nahi karenge kyuki e- rUPI to intrest zero de rahi hai jabki bank ke intrest kam ho sakte hai lekin zero to nahi hote hai .agar 0.5 % bhi milega to log bank mai hi rakhna pasand karenge......koi hai jo mereko risk factor samjha sake.
941,How to opwn  E account
942,I think UPI is much easier to understand  and use
943,Sir can I convert my Bank A/c balance into e-R......??
944,Every NRI should able to buy erupee
945,Is data storage of all transaction free? Obviously there will be cost for e rupee also. In future it may be transferred to end users
946,"From what I can predict, after few years UPI with charge some MDR amount for each transaction and digital rupee won't, and as people after already habitual of online money transfer, all the people using UPI will divert towards E-rupee."
947,e - rUPI k chalane k liye koi kharcha nehi hota hai keya?
948,UPI is ok.
949,E rUPI kai liyai ek alag account khona padey.

954,E Rupee will be used in exchange of foreign currency in future.
955,e-rupee will FAIL
956,"Well, both will coexist. We need new tech, some chip type system so that e-rUPI becomes successful."

963,Good option to reduce pressure on banks for handling physical currency
964,Wonderful explain
965,"In short its like Paytm wallet, dont need bank account to receive paytm wallet money either. and accepted only at participating merchants, and no interest on paytm wallet money its just laying there. I find it bullshit though compared to UPI.. where transactions are happening directly bank to bank.. no wallet reload bullshit, no unnecessary headache. Govt is seriously advertising it as &quot;No need to have bank&quot; ? is it so hard to get a bank account ? takes few minutes for online bank acc opening with leading banks like icici, axis, hdfc. and almost every one.. even kids have a bank account. Better go behind corrupt politicians who loot us in daylight rather than causing unnecessary headache to common ppl."
966,"I think when the government will issue digital rupee, the amount of digital rupee issued will call out that amount of cash from market or banks. Therefore the dependency on cash will decrease but the major problem arises here is that, will a person be able to pay without internet? Well let's see when RBI will launch Digital rupee, the Pros and Cons. Let's wait for future."
967,Nice ma'am Thankyou
968,Awesome explanation. Thanks to Groww team.

988,Who is the Target market of this project ?
989,But only because of the cash economy we survived the global recession of 2008. Had we been cashless economy like EU and US. we would be destroyed by now.

996,Means banks will  suffer after this?
997,"Very informative and easy to understand, thanks"
998,Excellent explanation madam.. very impressed and impressive..
999,"The only problem with CBDC is that the Government is the only one who can see all the transactions, then they could start making financial policies to control how people use their own money (like what you buy , tell you what you shouldn't buy and change your ideologies &amp; believes for their own benefits).  CBDC is a good thing but the individuals in Government can use it for their own personal agendas without us even knowing.  It has a chance to make us simply the puppets to the Government. {It starts being a question of freedom} Please think about this point of view üôèüèªüòä"
1000,UPI and cbdc are good an all but govt should focused more on cyber fraud as well
1001,Flop show hoga digital rupee. Cryptos like BTC  were born because nations are borrowing more than what they can pay and that leads to devaluation of currencies. Then people started using cryptos to transfer money. Many including big financial institutions started speculating. There is no merit in having a digital and physical currency  both at the same time.

1034,"Very critical topic with a simplified analysis ,easy to understand. Superb"
1035,Awesome 
1036,Aleena explained the concept really well with simple examples !
1037,You are wrong. The model you explained is one of the 3 possible models of CBDC.  Also your explanation of clearing and settlement is also wrong. Clearing happens in real time that is customer to customer account. However the banks settle in a periodic way. That is a model in india. In other countries it will clear and settle in real time
1038,CBDC can  stop corruption and detect Black money also.
1039,Ab UPI se bhi logon ko nichoda jayega UPI pe charges lagake

1051,Bahot videos dekhne k bad ab samaz me aya digital currency kya hai... Thank you. Paytm ki ad kam karo...
1052,I want further videos on this topic
1053,"Another insightful video üíØ One more thing that I was thinking about is that unlike physical currency which wears and tears out after certain years due to constantly exchanging hands, CBDC will have no such problem. It will exist till kingdom come."
1054,"10 din ho gye par mera account acitve nhi huva ye message dikha rha h we appreciate your patience, and we are working hard to active your stock account soon.   help kare"
1055,Very precise and understandable
1056,"If any country including India or US or China or Russia or BRICS currency  wants to keep their currency strong, they may eventually back up CBDC with five percent of GOLD.This could be beginning of the end of Fiat currency.Not to forget that All Central Banks in the World are aggressive in purchasing GOLD for last one year."
1057,Cbdc is future of india
1058,What blockchain is used by Indian government for cbdc ?
1059,In this subject any Stock present?
1060,"The real thing to be seen is reliability of CBDC. Sometimes the money is debited at our end, but not received at retailer's end. This happens rarely on Paytm, but I have heard it does happen. The question is, will CBDC be able to overcome this problem?"
1061,"What is any major difference between net transfer of funds between bank accounts at the end of day, AND between two RBI accounts for every transactions(no matter how small), anyway? I suppose the costs would be comparable? If yes, then I really don't understand the utility."

1095,"Trical down economy is killing india, copy cat economists are in Government. Don't trust economy Model it's copy of USA government economy Model, USA will enjoy bad recession in 2023 and 2024 because currency printing Techniques , Printing currency will not work ,gold standard will come in to economy system.. Only Adani, Ambani's will enjoy life. Take loans enjoy For 2 years 2023,2024 and 2025 will be good."
1096,Best ideas is take higher  loan Amount for 25 years and enjoy life with hard Cash. If u can't pay 2 years of EMI . It's ok.2025 will solve ur loan EMI. U will enjoy bad periods. That's it enjoy.

Absolutely no 1 is investing to finland because of the taxes and companies are leaving or going bankrupt constantly. Rich people and refugees are doing great but everyone else are loosing everything

1193,"While you are praising the smart contracts and social score as positive, I see it as main threat of CBDC. Take example of China, when you connect digital currency with credit score you are headed into nightmare. While you can still handle cash, once the CBDC is introduced, you will lose ability of paying once your credit score is down. More importantly Central Bank will have possibility of 'switching you off' with a simple click. So for example if (due to your opinions) you become labelled with low social score - the Central bank can 'destroy' your cash with one click.<br>However when you holding cash - the power of state (and Central bank) is quite small over you."

This, therefore, is perceived as being a great progress and a great convenience, where, in reality, is a great menace to your personal freedom and your rights.  This menace applies to the peoples of India, China, USA, Russia Barbados, or <i>any</i> country on the planet.  The much touted transaction benefits can be done right now without money digitalization.  Besides, if you are an asylum seeker, and are fleeing a country where your identity is tied to the centralized money, <i>as</i> <i>all</i> <i>digitzed</i> <i>money</i> <i>will</i> <i>be</i> , your traceability is also immediate.  There is no escaping.  Further, the combination of credit and debit, eliminates float and the time float affords you to earn interest income before you pay off your credit balance.  Earning a higher percentage for deposits in a Centralized currency and its payment in monthly installments, is another gimmick to incentivize you that can and will be changed up or down, or taken out altogether, at a whim or convenience of the government."

1320,"Do we have / own sufficient bandwidth for network required for mobile network, tv network, cable network, satellite communications and what not ? Does having a payment portal like pay tm, e pay etc makes us enough competent to challenge International system like SWIFT ?

Or is this one more way to keep stupid bhakt bz to divert from my price rise, inflation, unemployment etc ? Or just a Jumla as they would say after failure"
1321,"Sorry to say but couldn't understand the concept. Our money is currently stored in banks, banks are liable for this money and transaction. So where this CBDC will be stored?

And if it's gonna replace the banks, where this bank people will go?"

1330,Thank you for giving update about this digital rupee.
1331,one thing which i did't get the clarity is <br>this system method will help the indivisuals to make transactions without the <br>1.ATM<br>2.UPI<br>3. BANK ACCOUNT<br>now the question is without having bank account which consist money from which source the transaction will get executed.
1332,"Hey quick questions: 1. Do all digital currencies work on DL/Blockchain technology? <br>2. How would the digital rupee work without internet connectivity? How would the transaction be logged?<br>3. Where / how will the digital currency be stored? For normal bank-bank / upi transactions, the records are stored in the application through which the transactions are done and the bank account statements. For physical cash, the actual money changes hands. What happens in the case of digital currencies?"
1333,Superb video üåà
1334,"The financial system is already a known Ponzi scheme. It's better to also talk about the cons of CBDC. You've made it look like the best thing to adopt by a common man. We've given too much control to the Government already, is it healthy to give more control of our human rights. We'll be dependent on the government after this. Don't you realise the speed at which the government supplied COVID vaccination to the entire country, but why was it so inefficient when it was about polio or malaria vaccination? It basically shows that the Government has its own agenda. We're basically factory workers in a corporation, where we're not allowed to know corporate strategies and secrets. They provide for you, so you can contribute to the economy (or the SYSTEM). I know there are some absurd conspiracy theorists, who talk about flat earth, but some conspiracies are more of a fact than theory. In fact science is based on theory. You can be among the ignorant if you choose to. There is nothing to be proud of the current monetary system, it's purely a scam, even the economist agrees to this 100%. It's designed to be so complicated to understand, so no ordinary man can figure it out. If everyone realises the truth, there'll be a bankrun. The monetary system will collapse the next day."
1335,I also have another question. Since remittance is a big source of income for India. Let's assume US resident wants to transfer money to India. He goes to SBI in NY. Money recieved in dollars by SBI stays with the bank and can be used for Indian import settlement with US. Digital Indian currency is credited by SBI in Indian recipient's account. It's a book transfer instead of real. Is this right for digital currency?<br>Normally bank's buy currency from market at prevailing exchange rate for transfer. They also hedge. Hence process takes time (3-5 days).

1339,"Great video. Loved your simple explanation.<br> However some concepts still need clarity mainly:<br>1. Gold, silver back the currency issued by Central Bank. Digital currency is backed by what? What if there is cyber theft as seen in many crypto accounts? What if there is some mistake like overissue of currency since this currency is not backed by gold &amp; silver. <br>2. A smart tech, global consensus and high trade vol.  is needed to be the best digital currency. Is there something more?<br>I would love to see a second part on this."

1392,That was really very informative video. And the concept of CBDC is great but I was also thinking about its impact on the earnings of the current banks as most of the banks charge fees for the transactions carried out by them. Also will that also makes banks obsolete in a way ? Please share your thoughts on this ?
1393,"Will bank have any relevance for day to day transections if this is used?<br>I think the banking system currently will cease to have any relevance in transections and will be only limited towards providing other financial services like (loans, offers, etc.)<br>What are your views on it?"
1394,Unemployment shows how much we are growing
1395,"The one thing that you did not cover are the disadvantages of CBDC and how it can be misused by governments. For example, the Chinese government which is known for its oppression of some Muslim communities can completely block off their access to certain goods and services. The policy making with respect to subsidies will be controlled by politicians and will be used by them to control their vote bank. This is especially not good in a country like India."

1427,"So CBDC is belonging to a government bank, correct? What profit will it make through the transactions? If all the transactions go instantly the bank don't have time to use the money through it's own investment manipulation to get more profit. Am I right? And when the bank A of one country sends the money to the bank B of another country will there be any transaction percentage (and who will pay it) or they will make profit trough dif currency rate?"

1451,"The money in bank account accumulates  interest. The digital Ruppee will be like cash. So people will continue using bank accounts and with that NEFT and IMPS transactions. When different banks will be involved again there will be backend clearance. To make this work, banks might also have to use some clearance mechanism in form of Digital rupee transfer with one another.<br><br>So perhaps there will be two type of digital transactions.<br>1. The new Digital cash eRuppee  transaction<br>2. The traditional NEFT/ IMPS built on framework for Digital eRuppee transactions between banks."
1452,"Important to keep in mind: US$ has two dimensions that is embedded in global trade, investment, financing as well as huge part of the Central banking reserve system. All fiat, notes or digital is only backed by a GOVt, called FIAT money. There is US$ in the US and there is the so called EURO DOllar system, started in the 70;s with petro dollars. Indian experts need to keep this mind. To minimize the role of USD in trade, investments and banking is no easy task....Even now, Chinese currency is not part of global trade, investments and banking."

1504,"Also, the govt can keep a direct tracking on every single Rupee transaction being done anywhere in the country and outside. With time, what you consider a 'rupee' (a stock variable) will stop being relevant, only the 'transaction' will be of value. Your stock of Rupees in the bank or a wallet will be a temporary point in the series of these transactions. Backed by a blockchain. When physical currency ends, you can no longer hoard it. Right now, you might decide to give Rs. 5000 to your maid in cash, the govt can't exactly track it. Govt just has an overall idea of how much money is in circulation in the country, they don't know WHO has it or had it in the past. Digital currency will forever put your ownership stamp in these flow of transactions. <br><br>Also sometime in future - spending limits on every aspect of life can be pre-decided (I'm not saying they will be - but the possibility will be there). <br><br>But then, future generations will be born and raised in such a world so they won't mind it, because they've never seen the previous levels of financial freedom. <br><br>Also, if you're a common person going about your everyday life, it wouldn't affect you individually, it could only affect you as a part of a group. But if you every have an opinion against the govt.. well, just know that there will be a magical option to make all your money 'disappear' from the systems. I'm not saying it WILL happen, but the possibility for it to happen has been created."
1505,One line answer to your question. India can never destroy the SWIFT network.

1528,"A central bank digital currency is a double edged sword. You can talk all day long about benefits but at the end of the day the Government in the country that issues digital currency has a complete view of every single transaction done by the individual .. even more so it can control how much you spend on your purchases because the Government can label it as environment unfriendly or whatever reason if it wants to or is forced to by bigger more powerful Governments<br><br>I am not impressed with the story of Finnish refugees... This is just a smoke screen to enact digital currency ultimately for not just refugees but all the citizens of Finland... The refugees program is a Beta test more likely<br><br>Ultimately the problem of fiat currency doesn't go away just because you went digital... The fundamental problem remains... you are printing money out of thin air with nothing to actually back it up...the digital currency will put an end to the pretense that we are actually using money.. we are simply making changes to ledger entries.. instead of physically printing cash from nowhere, the Government will print it electronically.."

1543,"1/I am not still clear what are the advantages of CBDC over what we have now. For example, there is no CBDC at present in Canada, however, I can send money to anyone in Canada going to the website of my bank and initiating a transfer by using the Canada wide system called InterAc. All one needs is the receiver's email. Nothing else.The transfer is made without bank's human intervention: the sender gets an email that the money is sent aa well as when it is accepted by the other party; likewise, the receiver gets an email advising the transfer. Where is the advantage of CBDC?<br>2/Excuse me but: When you compare IDFC and others, isn't the illustration of the benefits of monthly interest credits v. quarterly rather misleading since you aggregate that with the higher IDFC's rate of 4% v 3% Perhaps you could have said that benefits of monthly v. quarterly credits on Rs 5 lakh deposited is Rs371/per year, the rest being due to higher rates offered by IDFC. Just to be fair to your listeners. <br>Thank You."

1553,CBDC will spy on you and control you. It can even be turned off if the government or bankers don‚Äôt like what you are saying or how you are spending your money. There is no more privacy in any part of your life if you allow CBDC to be implemented!

1559,"Awesome explainer! You really continue to impress me young man. Kudos to you.<br><br>I would add 2 other important aspects that will prove to be critical to the financial health of a country - CBDC‚Äôs will enable the Indian government to aid, support and subsidize its population during extreme times of crisis (like the pandemic) but limit spending to nominated suppliers preventing unnecessary foreign exchange erosion when this aid money is abused for purchasing goods from outside the country or for unnecessary goods. <br><br>Additionally, India‚Äôs large population and its ability to deploy easily a rupee based CBDC (given its mobile phone penetration, ID card implementation, its population‚Äôs familiarity with e payments) will augur well for the Indian rupee exchange rates - as its able to maintain a large and healthy demand of CBDC across the globe (for starters the USD 81 B) remittance not even taking into account all the export trade based on CBDC!"
1560,"Wish you had spoken a bit about the cons of CDBC. There is a reason central banks shouldn‚Äôt be given supreme power. For ex, Twitter shuts down accounts of people who do not share their views. Central bank can do the same with CDBC. <br>The current UPI is working brilliantly for remote users. We already have an efficient digital platform for small users. There is no clear explanation on how CDBC will reduce cross border payment commissions. <br>It is very dangerous for central banks to get into credit ratings and loan disbursals. Why don‚Äôt you just sell of the country to Adani and Ambani . They are already getting unlimited loans through the current setup. <br>May be my understanding of CDBC is wrong , but it feels like D means dictator here"
1561,"Say good bye to privacy, private transactions, street merchants, anything that relies on cash."

1565,That's why they are focusing on Aadhar linking porcess so that a non banker person can be traced using e-rupi and increased the scope of taxability. Is it ?
1566,So these CBDC will have their own blockchains I guess. This seems to be a death blow to bank as these will bypass them. One fear compared to cash is that these digital rupee can be withdrawn at any time when the government seems right at the push of a button.That sort of centralized control is not good. If some misuses power UR networth can be zero overnight. Anyone who opposes the government  may be targeted like opposition  or human rights groups. The central banks will remain in cahoot with financial institutions .

So if you break a law, or go against norm you can get penalized and even have your bank account deactivated. Imagine if the U.S. had this right now. In Canada banks froze accounts of thousands that participated in the Trucker Protests. Ethics must be discussed because politically our governments are far too evil to truly unleash the positive potential of such technologies."

1759,i dont see any benefits of CBDC. it is just like UPI and even in UPI you can make offline payments. also he gave an example of some remote island who is using CBDC which is not relatable to our indian context. in my opinion CBDC is a new fancy and expensive project which govt  doesnt understand and is going to cost our economy more than demonetization

1765,"This is going towards demonetization, and government will control that how we'll spend money and that's really scary.

1786,in today's era no fiat backed by any commodity
1787,Very nice article. But I believe this is more relevant for the cbdc retail which is yet to be launched. Also wouldn‚Äôt this disintermediate the banks from the financial system which in turn will increase systemic risk on rbi itself. Banks also help create money supply by giving loans which the rbi will be unable to fulfill. Just my thoughts
1788,"CBDT is a waste of time. It is designed by the Governments to diverrt people away from blockchain. Currency is already digital, we already have UPI. I can already pay online. CBDT just would make RBI do something that it is not equipped to do - create individual accounts. If people can save their money in RBI account, why on earth would they use any other bank? So it will kill banking as we know it. It will be a maintenance nightmare for the RBI and a terrible tragedy for the banks."

Like WEF. <br>Now this digital currency will be a control system on where the money is spent and by whom .<br>Like the banks can decide if you spend on food or drugs. <br>And this can spiral down whne the political will is against the nation. <br>Banks might not alow you to spend your money on something whcih is against the then narrative. <br>Like you can't fund a opposition party if the governing party don't want you to. <br>If the govt thhinks and NGO is against the govt, they'll never be allowed to collect cash. <br>You can extrapolate easily. <br>This will be bad.move"

Demonetization, some of my relatives genuinely expected 10 lakh or something as promised by the govt.<br>2. Start- up the new revolution, look at the current status, no start up ecosystem has benefitted the ordinary folks.<br>3. 5 trillion economy by 2025, there was a book or something written on it, what is the status?<br>4.

Instead of the debt in paper currency which could be printed in billions without any gold backing by a switch is now going to be in virtual digital system without any gold backing much more worse than the paper currency. Atleast paper currency you can be sure you hold it and spend it on what ever you wish for. But CBDC can be switched on or off from your account any time the government wishes. CBDC can control what you spend on, and who can spend it and who does not depending on your credit score."

And 10 or 20 years later, when the system's flaws start affecting ordinary people, then everyone will wonder how people were so stupid to begin with. Smart contracts have serious security issues. Blockchain makes an economy extremely energy-dependent (something India needs to always import). Ledgers provide detailed intelligence about any individual to anyone who can access it.

1897,As someone who's been following Cryptocurrency and blockchain applications for a long time now CBDCs are a boon for governments but if not implemented properly it puts way too much control in the hands of the government and can be a BIG problem from a privacy point of view for individuals since the government can directly track all the transactions being made by individuals

1900,Monthly interest is available on AU Bank already

1902,"It is nicely explained, except I did not follow one thing. In case of UPI the video explains that the delta of the transaction is transferred between the banks at the end of the day. How is that not the case in the case of the CBDCs? Why do the CBDC rupees directly transfer between customer account and merchant account. Can @Think School or anyone explain?"

1914,Sorry to say this but there is no significant advantage of this digital currency. The example of refugees is a black swan event so it doesn't really weigh in as a great usecase. Using a digital currency makes sense for a weakly connected country like Bahamas but not for India.
1915,nice
1916,"We have mobile apps on retails banks now, why would you need a CBDC in the Bahamas, still no need to go to the banks? As a side note, I used to work for a company making core banking engine, where we already had smart contracts, so even that is already here. Blockchain technology implies distributability, which is not inherent to CBDC, quite the opposite. I think this video is missing a point about the control that CBDCs give to central governments, which is a major concerns given the world we leave in and the decision being taken by government and non-government organization. CBDCs remove so much friction, the question is would you trust your own government with so much power?"

1944,"Amazing. Simple, clear and precise explanations for financial novices like us. Appreciated ."
1945,But cbdc can rise terrorism??
1946,The question lies that why will india adopt to digital rupee and go through pain of change of process of transactions system with upi availability üò¢
1947,"There are many cons of CBDC.<br>No privacy, total authoritarian regime. Govt can montor every transection , can block any transection. <br>CBDC is coming in all countries. CBDC is the idea of imf and wef. These institutions are pressing every govt to bring CBDC. Imf and wef is owned by very powerful people on earth. And they want to remain in power and to do so they dont want this (debt based, crippled) financial system to change. Bitcoin is the threat to current financial system and the powerful people has only one last card to play that's CBDC."
1948,"And why not use the CBDC in restricting the first time user of reservations/caste quota  in India by a person from a certain community. Track them and block them after one-time usage of reservations in jobs, education, welfare schemes, promotions in govt. jobs etc..? Can this be practically implemented in such scenario? I wonder...."
1949,Yeah it can because Russia is also developing something similar so I guess it's a coordinated approach between different countries and this isn't something developed in the last hour

1952,"They are massive disadvantages that come with CBDC. And I believe it's important for you to explain this issue in another video. This initiative was not founded on the basis of protecting citizens but rather tighten control of the <a href=""http://masses.it/"">masses.it</a> will become apparent, because government will have enormous powers to do exactly what they want at any given time. Why! Because they can exclude you from all economic activities altogether indefinitely if you do not do what they want. And that is maybe a price we have to pay unfortunately."

1961,"Somehow I get the feeling that the present government needs to remain in power to implement this (and all the benefits of this) in a reasonable timeline without wasting any time. Anyway, how many of you think India can beat China in this race?"
1962,"poor video not explaining why CBDC's are horrendous,giving complete control of our money to governments."
1963,And they say... What has modi done?? He is doing what congress taught waste of time.

I have three questions<br>1: As you gave first example, I suppose digital rupee isn't block chain based and i didn't understand the logic of first example. but i remember for this example government has started tocken QR code which could be used for scholarship.<br>2: so in future we wouldn't have to have bank account or there won't be any bank?<br>3: as currency change or cross border transaction technology is still in process, digital rupee may help as no bank system required. what could be more practical use of digital rupee?<br>Thank you for these very informative and lovely videos."

1970,The only thing I'm afraid of is cyber crime. Our Government should invest in cyber security as well. Going online is good but being vulnerable is not good at all.
1971,Its a very good Idea.
1972,But what abt exchange rate fluctuations
1973,I did not understand it. It was too technical.
1974,IF A FEW INCIDENTS OF HECKING CUSTOMERS WALLETS WILL BE NOTICED THAN ATTRACTION FOR DIGITAL CURRENCY WILL DISAPPEAR...
1975,"Well explained, you are the person who makes me to understand most of the topics so simple. The way of explaining through example is marvelous. Great work bro.<br>Now in this topic, how it controls bribe and black money?"
1976,"All this already exists via different cryptocurrencies. The problem with CBDC, is that it can easily be used to create dictatorships around the world. I'm shocked the creator of this video did not consider that obvious outcome!"
1977,"Thanks for sharing the positives of CBDC but you forget to mention the cons <br><br>further surveillance, know where when and what exactly you are spending your money on<br>Data farming<br>The government can freeze your account easily of they dont agree with your political views<br>."
1978,"haha, China's issue is exactly that they cannot make money readily available because it'll change the existing balance of power really fast. It only empowers selected individuals that will not be threat to party and cannot let money fall into some other figure that they cannot trust. They just simply cannot take that sort of thing. This insane paranoia of losing power is a living reality of China. They are 100% fine with corruption because they can use alot of their people as scapegoats but they cannot actually start being fair and just because they'll end up losing power and this exact thing is going to stop them from actually being people friendly. They want to control people's life, their wealth, their property, their sex life even. Power and Dominance has always been their thing, empowering people is always ever going to be selective and on their terms."
1979,If everyone could send money without bank account why would anyone in future open a bank account. And what is the role of banks and how could they make money?

2003,"CIA of US and EU are getting exposed with their sinister plans, leading to needs for alternative to SWIFT, since they were weaponized. NATO and CIA have ZERO credibility and United Nations should be declared as defunct institution for people other then US and EU."
2004,"If this comes into force, then the government will have total control of an individual's money.  Since the technology will be with the government, they can easily stop an individual gain access to his money.  Government can levy taxes on individuals such as carbon tax and all kind of restrictive taxes on people.  The whole world is trying to go the digital currency way, which means this is another tool to subjugate the masses...This tecnology should only be used for foreign trade and remittances and not for normal banking.."

2011,Thank you.
2012,"The issue is, india's methods for a SWIFT replacement are too complicated. When I use swift through axis bank the money gets transferred right away to my account based in UK. If I use the SWIFT through icici, indian bank(govt) the process is too complicated because they literally ask for proofs of income like gift deed, salary slip of last 6 months and some other stupid proofs. Money in bank is 100% white, why make process difficult? I understand if its for big transactions like 1 crore+, but even for small transactions like 1lakh there is way to many documentation from indian side. If anyone has been to west, will know how easy and seamless the process through SWIFT is. IF RBI can match that, they can definitely become big, if they keep things complicated like how it is right now? I dont think they can even dent SWIFT"

2022,Seeing the current scams the checks and balances are not in place in banks. Now this new system will complicate things.
2023,The whole point of a blockchain is to have a decentralized system that a small group of people don't control. A government controlled blockchain is analogous to a horse pulling a car whose engine has been removed.

In essence making all who own it the bank themselves. Centralized will be just as it is today.. money will depreciate more and more.. So.. you tell me what is best

2062,"3 points I didn't like in this video, I hope you'll correct it:<br>1. Western Union doesn't charge very high conversion rates or transfer rate. I transfer frequently and it turns to be around a diff of 40paise per dollar, and the transfer fee is flat 0.99$ no matter the amount.<br>2. Most of the time I receive the amount instantly even when the amount is in the range of lakhs.<br>3. You calculated the savings interest in case of HDFC bank compounded annually, but it should be quarterly, and the amount should come to be slightly more than 15000. But you did calculate the savings interest of IDFC bank compounded monthly, I wonder why such discrimination? Is it because you wanted to highlight the difference for your sponsor??"

Moreover, introduction of cbdc will permit the government to record every transaction made by a citizen and if necessary the ruling dispension can easily create problems for a citizen who does not tow the official line. Such interventionist situation already exist in China.  A Chinese citizen not in the good book of the authorities has to face severe consequences by carb on his economic freedom."

2111,"In your example, at the end of day,  HDFC needs to transfer 150 crores to ICICI.  Do they physically transfer 150 crores of paper currency? I am assuming that HDFC and ICICI has accounts in RBI  and RBI subtracts 150 crores from HDFC account and add it to ICICI. So, everything happened electronically. What did e-rupee do extra?  In USA, we use physical currency very rarely. We use credit, debit cards most of the time. I did not feel any drawbacks for not having e-dollar. Looks like I did not understand e- rupee well!!"

2213,I think you failed to mention the centralised nature of these CBDC tech. In these times where democracy is on the line CBDC will act as sniper rifles where you can blacklist the accounts and stop services for  the individuals or a group that the government dislikes.Apart from this the smart contracts are too much vulnerable and could be hacked....and if the government's used crosschain bridge for interacting with other cbdcs then it would be extremely vulnerable ........I think the best approach would be a decentralised currency with zero knowledge verification for the wallets.....pls ignore any typo mistakes..........suggesting you to make a video on defi(decentralised finance)........üíØ.......btw nice work...üòÅ

2232,All is ok about the video but don't be so naive about the immigrants in Finland. Many of them face horrific racial abuses. Also how will expats transfer their currencies to India without SWIFT? One option is for India to open their own banks or at least an intermediary bank account in all countries to which expats can transfer money and this Indian offshore bank or the bank account can then transfer the money to the Indian bank account. I doubt if the white imperialist western countries will agree to any of this unless India puts more pressure on MasterCard and visa. Lastly think-tanks like Atlantic Council have anti-India agendas.

I think with respect to disadvantages of govt interference, you can take reference from Nobel Prize Winning Economist Milton Friedman. He has a whole Playlist related to this known as Free to Choose. I think you can use practical examples to explain about Free Markets, socialism and disadvantages with govt interference.

RBI Concept Note on CBDC does outline the challenges that you highlighted, so clearly the govt. has deliberated on the risks and challenges, esp, related to the intermediation on the role of banks vis-a-vis credit.... and 2. The pilot has just been launched, which would hopefully help identify these and also flush out the inefficiencies. Mr. Rajan is a wise man, but the collective wisdom of the current govt is equally good. <br>Keep making such videos, as it&#39;s always nice to hear your point of view. Cheers!"
2326,"Hi, great analysis on CBDC. From where I am looking at it seems like the government is trying to eliminate physical cash from the economy. This also points to lesser instances of black cash getting stashed."
2327,"The main advantage as I understand is adding smart contracts to CBDC which prevents the misuse of subsidies/crop loans etc., For example, bank offers crop loan/AG Loan to farmers at a subsidized interest rate and this is getting credited to bank account or given in cash  this is being utilised in a wrong way i.e instead of using that money for agriculture purpose  they are using this for purchasing luxury items or childs education etc., i.e using it for anything other than agriculture (in most cases). So if smart contracts are introduced to CBDC this can be prevented. using smart contracts it can be programmed in such a way that it can be utilised for purchasing only to which its intended for . Please feel free to correct me incase of my above understanding is incorrect."
2328,Gov. Just found the recent crypto crash a way to introduce the CBDC so they could try and regulate the crypto world. And it is not just India plenty other countries are trying to introduce their form of CBDCs. The motto might be to control the crypto transactions and it might help tax those who have invested invested in Bitcoin and Etherium and other coins.
2329,Great analysis and Kudos to you for being honest in such difficult times! Initially I thought you are trying to sell CBDC but thanks for being rationale on such a sensitive topic. I hope the regime will not push it forcefully otherwise it will be Noteban 2.0.

2332,worst policy I think so
2333,"UPI became successful only after opening Jan Dhan Bank account for each and every citizen till the ground level and implementing Demonetization after that, then after citizens forced to adopt this change and now it became a success story. Everything was well thought and planned."
2334,Thanks Akshay for touching and making us literate on topics which I think nobody covers. Your way of explaining things is great and best line is &quot; to cut the long story in short&quot; üòÄ..... Great work... Keep it up...
2335,"Hi Akshat, one thing I can think of is international trade. As of now, it is extremely complicated with nostro Vostro accounts and multiple banks. Instead, if we use CBDC of let us say US and India to do trade, we can cut out a lot of these middlemen. The central bank of each country is known to the central bank of every other country and hence the transactions have authority. Plus it will be faster, cheaper and more secure. We can also have DCs for different trading groups, like BRICS, ASEAN, QUAD etc. with weights for individual CBDCs and seamless conversion. Is it possible or just a pipe dream?"
2336,I think CBDC can help in international payments and might help vastro account process. <br>Some usages of it can‚Äôt be directly stated by govt officials but it can help strengthening the rupee in long run
2337,When Upi was introduced people also questioned it but everyone knows how upi helped us grow in a better way
2338,"Despite the economic downturn, I&#39;m happy ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I have been earning $60,200 returns from my $10,000 investment every 13 days"
2339,"I&#39;m done sitting tight for the award advance since i acquire$23,000 every 12 days of my investment."
2340,this is the only video which covers disadvantages too
2341,"Pardon me if I am being naive. In my view the banks will continue to do their business - they will continue to credit people&#39;s salaries, they will continue to lend, borrow and so on. Not clear why this feeling of threat from RBI. May be I am oversimplifying- at least for starters, CBDC is a good idea to replace paper currency  not entirely though. I doubt RBI would want to replace the banking system as a whole! That&#39;s infeasible even if they wished. It&#39;s much better bossing the banks around than doing their job!!"
2342,I think the main advantage could be like paying from e-wallet to e-wallet without involving any banks. üëç
2343,"I am quite impressed to see people talk about the best market trader, I have been a client of his for over a year and I can attest to his professionalism. Most of my trades are successful with his assistance. He is an apt and transparent trader."
2344,"Nowadays, many medium sized shops are not accepting visa or MasterCard and accept only UPI <br><br>Who would&#39;ve thought? üòÑ"
2345,One benefit of CBDC could be to tag the currency with government welfare schemes and let that tagged currency be used only for the earmarked scheme. This way govt can prevent abuse of money allocated through such schemes.<br><br>For ex: Rs100 that is given by govt to a poor citizen to buy ration from PDS shop will be used only for that purpose and the citizen can be restricted to not use that currency for any other purpose.
2346,Cbdc is like a single ledger framework. It‚Äôs supposed to provide real-time transaction in books and enabling smooth syncing of commercial bank and rbi ledgers. There‚Äôs is small chance that it can help countries to by pass the swift system if the frameworks are similar for two countries.
2347,HI Akshat - I don‚Äôt think RBI CBDC is directly managed and issued by RBI. This is done through intermediary banks. You can read the RBI circular on 29 Nov. <br>Agree that there are no major advantages seen from a retail perspective. Thanks for simplifying the concept of CBDC
2348,"Hi Akshat! There&#39;s one thing I would like to know. Are these CBDCs uniquely traceable? If so, then a unit specific ownership history could be made. This could allow us to identify illicit transactions. Thus discouraging and reducing such transactions."
2349,The main advantage of CBDC is to facilitate transaction when there is no internet. This could help in rural areas where there is no internet connectivity to avail direct benefits transfer
2350,"Hi Akshat, my knowledge of CBDC is all from this video, but here&#39;s the benefit I see:<br><br>Since this system skips the layer of private banks during transactions, this will bring enormous transparency and accountability on transactions.<br><br>Think about the following:<br>- Tax transparency<br>- Debt / Loan transparency<br>- International transactions accountability (funding of terror and / or black money)<br><br>Also, since CBDC is a blockchain network (centralised, but anyway) it can also make eRupi an alternative for blockchain applications / businesses to use instead of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Although, Polygon or other blockchains might be a better choice at the moment, but it&#39;s the first initiative by Govt in the blockchain space and with time it might actually evolve into a viable option.<br><br>It mostly benefits the government, but I don&#39;t consider the &quot;janta&quot; to be separate from the government. I don&#39;t think this a zero sum game between government and the masses.<br><br>Again I am not sure about how it works and if these benefits will ever occur, but this is what I can see right now"

2354,"I don&#39;t know but when the whole world is trying to adopt and create their own digital currency  it is further refined and develops the block chain technology which is further used for multiple applications...i&#39;m not certain but RBI is always face problems to tackle inflation when RBI do operation regarding inflation curbing the commercial banks ignore or bent the guidelines, so might be possible that Rbi is concentrating more power ."
2355,The interest thing can be changed by listing the erupi in stock markets and bonds and etfs but you are right it will reduce earning potential of the banks
2356,"Super akshat... Nice, crisp n to point video.. Very Informative and easy to understand... Take a likeüôÇ"
2357,"If it allows government to crush certain communities, all the more reason to implement it."
2358,"Comparing Chinese Muslims problem with CBDC was really stupid <br>When we have technology where no middleman (banks) are required, why to give chance of any manipulation. <br>Corruption is eating the whole country from years and with small reasons now people shall be given chance to do anything they want.<br>Anyways RBI already collects data from the banks with information system which is mandatory for banks to provide."
2359,One of the reasons why I think the government n RBI is pushing it is to remove the intermediaries n for the transfer of money for direct benefit transfers n also to give various subsidies as its a pre programmable money. So yeah I hope it brings the efficiency that the system needs.
2360,Till now  the govt has taken many useless decisions like demonetization &amp; now cbdc is good to be one of themüòÇ
2361,"I strongly agree on the disadvantages of CBDC you mentioned din video. As earlier there wee phone banking came into existence and mostly politicians and higher bank authorities misused it, I think none form the public were actually avialing it. Seems this is just a experiment to minimize the hard cash uses in market and minimize the corruption."
2362,"A benefit is that maintaining UPI is costly and govt has to pay the banks for transactions, CBDC will be a direct transfer so the maintaining cost will be very low"
2363,"Short summary:<br>1. CBDC is an electronic version of rupee<br>2. CBDC is deployed on a blockchain and have a centralized ledger<br>3. No functional difference between making a payment by CBDC and UPI<br>4. CBDC seems to act in a way to empower governments more and take away power from banks<br>5. CBDC has no interest component. Better to keep money in bank to earn interest<br>6. CBDC is not designed properly and even the government is not able to properly lay out it&#39;s benefits<br><br>I guess government just wants more power over the money of the common man. They want lesser amounts of money to be left untracked via physical format, so that they leave no stone unturned for taxation. On the other hand, maintaining a centralized ledger would help people in power to eÃ∂xÃ∂pÃ∂lÃ∂oÃ∂iÃ∂tÃ∂ fight corruption more üôÇ See? Win win situation for the nation üôÇ"
2364,"thank you so much, it was really helpful."
2365,Digital Rupee won‚Äôt change anything right now but in future it might help Govt to track black money if adopted on wide scale
2366,"Blind rush to technology will lead to disaster.<br>First,all the adhaar cards of dead be deactivated. A life certificate every six months is necessary. Any account without living certificate should be blocked.There are chances of benami and dummy accounts hiding black money.<br>Some food for the government before doing gaga under technology.<br>Best known fact is no bank spends on security,also the government.Block chain will make it difficult to trace the identity.<br>Its easy for RBI to declare policy to save the banks and execute the customer for the system fault.All like MALLAYA AND MODI WILL BE AWAY FROM THE COUNTRY."
2367,Hiii akshat I would like to know more clearly thou u did manage to cover up almost all bullet points however if there are more disadvantages then positive changes of cbs then wts the whole point of govt wanting to introduce to mass by wasting huge masses money itself (as ur said there are more negative pls then being positive of implementing such a whole new money system be it in physical or digital format pls explain in detail in new video with regards to my query thks-keep up the gud work &amp; I appreciate ur precious time &amp; efforts to explain such intruige topics in very less time
2368,hi Akshat<br><br>Thanks for such an informative video on CBDC. Really appreciate this video because right from the announcement of CBDC I really didn&#39;t understood what real advantage does it provide to a common man. finally there&#39;s a video/information point on internet that explains it in relatively simple terms.<br><br>Thanks Again :)
2369,"Excellent videos, you always make tough concepts easy :)"
2370,"Had my doubts, wanted to see govt. argument....turns out govt. is running behind FOMO. CBDC in China is going to be used to essentially subdue the population financially and keep them in check. If seen getting out of line cbdc in China will essentially make you unable to spend money bcoz your identity will be linked. Simply put its not only CBDC but a version of programmable currency and to see what havoc that plays in the economy just wait and see after these Covid lockdown protests in China."
2371,"There is a mistake in your explanation,<br>Even if the money is in your bank account bank has to keep physical cash in lieu with that money in your account.<br>Also any new money that comes into the system RBI has to print cash and give it to banks, <br>Incase of e‚Çπ RBI will give banks money not in cash but in digital form .<br>So currently any money in the system (whether in bank account) will have to have a physical note somewhere but this will not be the case with launch of e‚Çπ"
2372,It is not clear as to how the problem of double spending will be resolved when money gets transferred from one wallet to another with out underlying blockchain.
2373,E-RUPI and e-Rupee are different as I understand. One is voucher system another is CBDC.
2374,"That&#39;s a very socialist approach from govt.<br>Why is govt doing that, i heard that the BRICS nation are also trying to come up with a digital currency among themselves which will be backed by gold. Is moving away form fiat currencies a wise decision for emerging economies? This might seriously hurt the creation of credit"
2375,CBDC real value comes in with Invoice payments.. we can discuss it if you have time..
2376,"Nice video. But, are you sure RBI using Blockchain technology to introduce e-Rupee or something else?"
2377,"After CBDC, Central Government will save the per transaction cost which is paid by the Finance Ministry to the respective bank for performing transaction(for the service provided).<br><br>As CBDC allows RBI to give the service to the customer directly Finance Ministry/Central Government will manage to save heavy amount."
2378,The main reason for introducing CBDC is that all the BRICS nations are introducing a currency of their own which is gold backed and it‚Äôs supposed to compete with USD <br>CBDC can easily exchanged with this new currency easily as it is more centralised <br>In the short term u r right but when u think of the future CBDC is definitely helpful<br>International trade will become a hell lot easier
2379,"What you are not talking about how different banks can be settle their transfers efficiently using CBDC  what takes 2 to 3 days happens within a few hours with CBDC - that is not being pointed out. That being said it does not really give an advantage to the retail users. However, this is a great tool for the settlement systems across the banks."
2380,I don&#39;t quite agree with your point here. CBDC is necessarily a digital version of physical currency. So everything that a bank does now .. can done with the e‚Çπ too. I think your assumption of banks as mere keepers/distributors of physical currency isn&#39;t accurate.
2381,"I am a Software Engineer in AmazonPay. I have a decent knowledge of the UPI system, and even I am unable to understand the advantages of CDBC. <br>One thing i would like to point out Akshat is that while power in the hands of government in India is a bad thing, in this case power wont be in the hands of the government. It will be distributed, and ledger information(hopefully) will be available publically with only public keys and wallet ids(similar to how ethereum networks are built today). This way, when a large transaction occurs it can immediately be brought into notice and government can be questioned or they can come into action if they suspect fraud or corruption. This can be a better approach to payment, but it has its flaws too. <br>One of the flaws which you missed is the flaw of Blockchain technology itself. Since its distributed in nature it has to maintain a lot of redundant data sets and since we are talking about scales as large as UPI network, it will be very inefficient to maintain so many ledgers. RBI currently only maintains the net inflow and outflow of cash through transactions from each bank, that too every 6 hours. Everything else is maintained by the Banks themselves. It will be interesting to see what more this tech has to offer..."

2384,"I have a feeling. Hear me out. Currently direct to bank transfers are in terms of money. So basically that money can be used for anything. Like jan dhan etc. I think CBDC will or could eventually launch a system where the money (e-rupi) can be transferred for a particular cause. For example, if PM launches a education yojna so that money can ONLY and only be used for fees. Or buying cycles or buying laptops or electricity bill. The smart contract will only work on certain condition. Might sound a little too much but could be this"

2387,Does RBI have the reserves of these e-rupees with them or is this created out of thin air?

2390,Erupi is also instrument to send money but it is different than upi as in upi you send money directly from bank 2 bank by same person .<br>In erupi one person can create voucher and give to some one else so they can use that voucher wherever it is decided by person who created it .<br>It is exactly like amazon shopping voucher where someone can create voucher by paying amazon some money and give it to anyone to shop on Amazon only.<br>In case of erupi usage is not limited to shopping but it can be used many places .Currently not much details is available but as per my knowledge this will be game changer as it will reduce misuse of money both in government and corporate.<br>Government now can create erupi and give it to farmer to buy only seeds in the form of seed subsidy instead of giving money to farmer account( DBT) where it is not gurantee whether farmer will buy seed or something else.<br>Corporate now can issue erupi voucher to there employee for there outstation visits for hotel access and travel expense instead of forcing employee to submit proof of expense<br>Health insurance company can simply go away with cashless card instead they can issue erupi to there customer which can only be used in designated hospital which will save there Hugh money.<br>It&#39;s usage can be many in future we will just see this to happen.<br>Once the adoption rate goes up  cash economy will vanish over long term. <br>Why do you not see these benefits from cbdc?

2393,"Good Video. But it is premature to conclude that it doesn&#39;t have major advantage. Just imagine a use case: On successful testing of CBDC, if Govt comes with a decision of all major transactions more than 10L(just an example), must be via CBDC, this may remove black money (For Ex. Real estate, Gold purchase etc.,).Lets wait and watch"

2415,You forgot to mention some points<br>1. Cbdc will be a substitute to swift network and others.

It will benifit atmarnirbhar bharat by linking with upi as it is free and there is no fee on any transactions unlike in usa and other capitalistic countries.<br><br>3. In near future we may even see atm getting obsolete as maintaining physical cash is a burden to government..so all my get digital.<br><br>4. As the e-rupi is backed by rbi as legal tender.. so in any fraud cause.. when someone swipe away ur funds..there is less chance u vll get it back...as today banks dont take responsibilities for any cybercrime... this will make rbi liable to give compensation to citizens.<br><br>Overall its a smart move by rbi to bring such remarkable instruement .

2442,Physical rupee notes will be done away with soon. Big savings in cost  paper  transportation  physical storage  etc and benefits environment too. Not sure why you can&#39;t see the benefits.
2443,One key point: This e-Rupee will also be a programmable rupee which can only be used where it is intended to be. So its all about control.
2444,"This is the 1st video of urs I ever saw and I have already subscribed to u.<br>I have seen a few videos regarding e-rupi  but no one was telling the main thing, HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM &quot;UPI&quot;, and why would people wanna shift to it. Thanks a lot for such a great in-depth video."
2445,Very informative and biased video ! Put yourself in place of government to eliminate the bias.
2446,instead of such useless thing govt can increase upi limit and no of transaction above ten <br> charge 1 or 2 rupess after limit
2447,"I don&#39;t agree with your argument that only 8% of INR is in cash &amp; rest are in digital format currently. Fact is for every so called digital currency (i.e. paytm or bank account) there is a back up of physical currency either with the commercial bank or with the central bank (RBI). So these UPI, NEFT, IMPS, RTGS, Cheques are all based on physical currency &amp; commercial banks clear their records for transfers within themselves at the end of the day with the help of RBI. Point is RBI have to print &amp; reprint these paper notes &amp; coins with huge expenses. With CBDC this this huge cost will evaporates. Add on benefit is you can not store it as black money. So your basic argument is not correct."
2448,Superb content
2449,"Through direct transfer central government directly buy votes, so subsidies will come directly from central government normal times state government divert money to free bies and corruption offers to politicians."
2450,when is the next batch coming on stock market?
2451,You aask too many questions before start of YouTube
2452,But which type of blockchain it is POS POW or ...?
2453,"I wonder, even now people are getting impressed by comments of Mr. Raghuraman Rajan"
2454,"Can a poor people or common people who do not have mobile phones use this &quot; E-rupi &quot; and how, please explain it to all 140 crore peoples of India so that each and every person can easily understand it  understand them in their language. Don&#39;t make such video that already have been uploaded by others youtubers. Namaskar."

2463,Hi Akshat  can you talk about the &quot;Securities Lending Income Program &quot; in Vested in your upcoming video?
2464,Just seeing spams and bots AWN27T as refferal code and see the likes on that comment all are more than the rest comments without refferal code so much of bots üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
2465,Digital currency means your money can be confiscated by the Government at the click of a mouse. Government is desperate to control public&#39;s money.
2466,Thanks Akshat! Good job of explaining complex things in simple words!
2467,no advantage over UPI only central govt having direct control over public pockets. and easy loans for adanis
2468,Finally govt. May decide everything what you can do with digital rupi and people may just be like slaves... already I doubt about the freedom of speech.
2469,Really good explanation of a very complicated topic... I&#39;m really glad that i am subscribed to you.
2470,"Thanks bud for keepin us financially Educated! Regardless of how bad it gets on the economy, I still make over $13,000 every single week"
2471,One of the advantages is that there are no middle man needed ( eg swift ). Peer to peer payment can be done and done in real-time. That is why cost would be less. Now if cost could be lowered then good better exchange rates could be given for such transaction. It would also be ready to use it for currency swaps in future between countries. US is already worried about there currency for the Chinese and moving to digital dollars. India wants to think in those lines.Advantage within india would be it would be highly efficient banking system especially recon. Going forwards a bank like HDFC could launch its own equalant of Visa credit cards. <br>Soon the govt. could create a use case for digital land transactions once the tech. Is in place linking backing and real estate not only for payments but for non tampered documents on blockchain too.
2472,If it prevents money laundering by banks to the defaulters like Nirav modi and Vijay mallya bcoz of them banks shuts and common mans money stuck into banks like PMc for years then what is the problem with CBD... Centralisation is always better...
2473,Receiving Remittances can be much more efficient via CBDC
2474,Tha Goverment should concentrate on monitoring how politicians hoard cash and take a cut on all Govt spendings. How many politicians will work for only salary. There is corrupt earning that is why politicians want to contest elections and come to power as they see good earning potential. This Govt is only after common peoples hard earned money.
2475,To face sanctions?
2476,"you speaks very fast, should be little slow like 0.75x so that every new person digest the content."

2478,"Digital rupee has greater control and transperant than current digital money, life of each note can be traced and conyrolled, current digital money you know movement ofceach account not each note ie the big difference, through smart money you can force some notes valid for only some transaction (purchases) only not valid for other purchases etc so gov can channelise didital notes to specific transactions only."
2479,Does India have any advantage of creating CBDC to establish INR as reserve currency in BRICS trade? Is that possible?
2480,"From the end user perspective, CBDC dosent provide any advantage over UPI. <br>It can be useful in countries which doesn&#39;t have something like UPI, but don&#39;t see it getting adoption in India."
2481,"You dont understand the topic itself, when you said that there is no real benefit of CBDC ..<br><br>By introducing CBDC <br><br>The digital cash systems ll be more secure and the ledger ll be distributed and there ll be no single point of failure.<br><br>As there is single source of truth then settlement ll be instantly and there ll be a huge cost saving in settlement.<br><br>3rd User ll have their own choice to keep custody of their own money in real sense by keeping thier money on non custodial wallet .. that mean giving more power to people<br><br>4th CBDC is programable like NFTs so Govt can introduce various program and money that is intent to spend on those projects ll only be spent on those project and there is 0 possibility of leakages. <br><br>5 - all exisitng system ll be enabled to work ll UPI qnd they ll not be abandoned like you had mentioned..<br><br>Last but the most imp .. influencer should not make video if they themselves have no knowledge on the topic"

2485,RBI is testing this CBDC model with bank. If bank is not involved in this CBDC. How the banks is allowing to test it?
2486,maybe it&#39;s time to get a good camera?
2487,"Fear-mongering, anti establishment agenda  fears. CBDT is bad because Chinese are misusing it! Bitcoin is good for some imaginary reason. You have no real argument against it."
2488,"CBDC mainly helps for horse trading of purchasing MLA and MP by BJP without distrubing public money. no need to worry of bank accounts, containers and suitcases."
2489,"I don&#39;t think this is gonna benefit a common man in our country. This system might ease the complexity with foreign exchange where if you can cut the middle man you can save the commission these intermediary entities charge, which again helps millionaires and billionaires attracting foreign investments. The government can&#39;t say this out loud that they are investing crores for a system that&#39;s gonna aid the elites, as it would cause chaos among the voting population that the government is again aiding the rich and ignoring the poor, hence the gov came up with some lame excuses of direct transfer of benefits to poor beneficiaries."
2490,CBDC will eradicate corruption.<br>Whatever road contract government giving all payments to be done in digital rupee. All the raw materials bought for the road contract should be in digital rupee.
2491,Thanks akshat. Feels good to know the details.
2492,What an amazing explanation sir

2494,"Because of the digital rupee, the volume of paper currency will come down and illegal transactions happening in cash will come down."

2502,"It would be better if <br>1.They introduced the e-rupi as a higher form of currency(token) like 1 e-rupee valued at 10000rs .So that in a way it would facilitate the small transaction into a larger sum.<br><a href=""http://2.as/"">2.As</a> a current account only currency,it can give you <a href=""http://intrest.so/"">intrest.so</a> that more n more marchants shall use those e-rupee.<br><a href=""http://3.it/"">3.it</a> should be named properly...e rupi does sound functional."

2512,"This video is basically ill-informed on almost every aspect-<br>The money one holds in bank A/C or in wallets is digital money for the user, not for RBI. RBI had to print notes in physical form somewhere at any point in time. e-rupi will be completely digital ie- produced and transferred.<br><br>RBI tends to gain control over anything which involves money, they are bestowed power and responsibility to control the inflation by a statute. <br><br>your views are highly political and misinformed. Even though you did not call any names, one can observe you&#39;re giving a negative connotation to this initiative merely because you don&#39;t like the government.<br><br>This video needs to be reported on a mass!"
2513,E-Rupi Ability to give Loans directly to corp-orates by RBI ( practically Government) is little bit dangerous as Capitalists are controlling most of the government policies by funding elections which in turn is returned by cheap loans to them .<br>Disaster is waiting ahead if this Adani/Ambani fails . I suspect they have huge NPA hidden below carpet as Banks do not have privacy issues in disclosing small retail loan defaults but Big defaults/NPA they &quot;See&quot; privacy issues  even Supreme court agrees !!
2514,"Pl go slow to understand it would be easier,"
2515,the centralised control of everything is always has it&#39;s threats. this move can even make easy to stash black money and transactions. cool
2516,One of the main advantages of this new distributed ledger is it will not leave any scope for physical intentional tampering of the subledgers held by the banks which eventually leads to an incomplete main ledger visible to the RBI.
2517,great job bro for making such we‚Äôll explained video
2518,Is it not due to crypto currencies popularity that government is also launching its own official crypto currency? what about tamper proof and auditing capabilities? Aren&#39;t they advantages of digital currency?

2526,"Very nicely explained. Yes, private banks will be starved of money for loan purpose. Maybe govt wants to monitor pvt banks that extend loans."
2527,"Will RBI Do the mining to issue Digital rupee like z,Bitcoin etc ?"
2528,i think there are fallacy in your argument. RBI is not getting into credit. it has been issuing notes in physical form ; not is issuing in digital currency ; the currency in circulation even today is decided by RBI/Finance ministry ; there is not transparent formula that is being used or public by neither rbi nor finance ministry. in fact RBI has started SGL-for bonds and now citizen open the account directly. this is to save the cost for the GOI as they had to pay money to the intermediaries being bank.
2529,looks like you are reacting too early like small children and popcorn youtubers. reference to rajan and uguhrs shows your where you are heading. please restrain from one sided views .
2530,Soon other banks will close because they will have no work hence banks will close and RBI will take complete control.. Then there will be no physical currency in circulation rupee will die and only digital rupee of RBI will function. This will be another disaster like demonetzation of indian rupee complete. God save india from disaster. Very bad future.poor man will be at hardship to survive.
2531,This system of govt control can and sure one day bring india into bankruptcy. Very dangerous trend and system of governence.
2532,you should host a debate with two sides - pros and cons - of CDBC. Will be interesting to see you and Think School&#39;s Ganesh Prasad üòÖ
2533,"Saraa english ek side pe, aur dusre side pe<br>Real india kisiko abhi samajh mai nahi aaya hai.<br>In the coming cash usage aggravate the economic growth. <br>The gvts think  citizens are fools."
2534,This is being done to end the role of comml banks because now there will be no need to open bank accounts . And gen public is going to be hit hard because than only few 2/3 banks will remain and wont give even 6 % int like present. Public will have to invest in capital fds  thereby benefitting cspitalists .
2535,"The Govt. officials like corporators and MLAs are doing some scams in a different way that they are wasting lots of money to build unnecessary gates, banners and statues, etc. and also doing district, taluka, railway station etc re-naming process..<br>This money is our Taxes so way they are doing it and wasting so much money.<br>Whether its really needed to do this. ??<br><br>Even when they took their meetings they are just enjoying their lunch, dinner, etc. This also our Tax money .. why ?? We giving the power to them all this shit ??"
2536,"Main purpose of CBDC is to create an Internationally tradable currency without using any of the current payment networks like Swift, which are controlled by West. In an eventual case of sanctions as in case of Russia where Swift payments were blocked disrupting trade this would help. <br><br>So in case CBDC is successful we would have a mechanism in place to trade globally without much disruption.<br><br>Second reason is INR is highly dependent on USD and hence is volatile. If trade happens in INR, importers &amp; exporters need not worry of Currency risk. Making INR more stable, creating lot value for business in the long run."
2537,I totally did not get the point where the China&#39;s people surveillance system is compared with the CBDT
2538,see think school video
2539,"Its e-rupee n not e-rupi,<br>Misleading content"
2540,Sir it may not succeed because politicians Nd businesses man cannot hide black money . This is my thought.
2541,jam yojana will be introduced because currently government is giving money to farmers and poor people. but government cant control how people will spend this money. so they will create voucher. which will people avail only on specific shops. for example if you are giving 5000‚Çπ worth of voucher to farmer he can avail in fertiliser shops or equipment shops only. that way money will not be wasted for other purposes.
2542,"It felt strange that you went so soft on e-Rupi. Government can invalidate your e-Rupi after certain period of time if you do not spend the money in order to keep economy in good shape. Government can prevent you from spending your own money on some of the things if they want to. With e-Rupi government can directly debit the money from your account with out your permission if you participate in dharnas, protests etc. Basically Government can enforce everything it wants, crushing individual freedom, choice. We all know what happens to such societies."
2543,A great explanation akshat ur eloquancy and knowledge are truly outstanding
2544,In short CBDC is a merchant account with the RBI instead of having an account with commercial bank. And this might be backed by a block chain infrastructure.
2545,"are you a puppet of IMF, WORLD BANK &amp; INDIAN GOVT. which explain this matter not with a cons only with pros why?"
2546,"Wonderfully explained ! Thank you for clarifying, i was also confused."
2547,Thanks a lot
2548,Awesome
2549,Vo you know something? As a complete layman I wondered ( and wonder now) what benfit to the concumer or the government the e-rupi( CBDC) would bring. I am relieved that you think that there would be no benefit at all. So I&#39;m going to eatch this space.
2550,CBDC is a Digital prison for the whole world. The sooner people recognise this the better it is. CBDC is the best tool for any dictatorial authoritarian rule. CBDC can be used to shut any individual or a group permanently just by switching them off digitally. Any one having different political opinion other than the government in control can be isolated permanently from the illusory digital financial services. You simply don&#39;t exist. Dangerous trend.
2551,"The best use for cbdc with a centralized ledger is to make sure we have a transparent system between loans being given to states from the center and it&#39;s utilization by states and vice versa for revenues being collected from states as part of cgst and sgst. If cbdc centralized ledger can utilise this through blockchain  it gives the citizens a lot of insight . But in relation to the video, the options where this is being utilized make no sense üòÇ"
2552,e-rupi is purpose specific there is no cash involvement anywhere whereas in DBT beneficiary gets direct money which gives discretionary power to use this money for any purpose even purchasing gutka too... a/c to me e-rupi is just one step ahead in initiating welfare to the people efficiently.
2553,It&#39;s not bank fd and sb for earning interest
2554,"Simply awesome  sir, the topic is indeed complex but you made it too lucid for any amateur... thanks !"
2555,no words i am just 200% agreed
2556,"I see this being used to provide Govt subsidies directly to people and reduce misuse of these money. Example, I have seen farmers take agri loans and buy cars and other luxury items. If the smart contracts are brought into action, govt/banks will put the erupi into bank account and the farmer can only use it for fertilizers, seeds/plantations, rentals for agri based vehicles and services and so on. This way we are plugging the leaks in a more polite manner. If govt takes action, then majority of the people will start protesting - hence this step. I could be wrong, but its only another way of understanding."
2557,UPI was not developed and institutionalised by raghuram rajan...<br><br>It was Nandan nilenkani team that developed india stack...
2558,great video as usual
2559,Great Analysis....
2560,The major reason is central government is subsidizing upi transaction due to multiple merchants involved as amount of upi transactions are increasing leaps and bounds it will cost lot more. There might be possiblity that in future upi transactions are charged as well like imps so CBDC could be an alternative to that plus adoption of blockchain technology which is transparent and much safe as well could be promoted.
2561,"The biggest problem in India is tracking government money allocated to needed people that will be solved, don&#39;t expect one implementation can solve everything in india"
2562,"Absolutely wrong interpretation of digital Rupi by Akshat. You are simply misguiding people against an excellent format of currency, Akshat. This digital currency will largely minimize the leakage of DBT money. Lot other benefits are also there."
2563,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My5pXiDCtU0&amp;t=15m05s"">15:05</a> Central Economy works great for china but converting India&#39;s economy into centralised one is problematic? why the difference?"
2564,do you make interest on cash in wallet? E-Rupi is same except in digital form where you no longer need to carry wads of notes in pocket...nothing less nothing more.
2565,Only benefit I see is being able to make payments even when there is zero connectivity with internet. I do use GPay. I have linked a Zero Balance account with it where in I keep no more than ‚Çπ 2000/- to limit my risk in the event of hacking or physical loss of the phone. So even in this case if I were to get an account or what ever I would maintain no more than a couple thouand rupees as emergency should I get stranded in the middle of nowhere and need to pay someone. So no matter what the landing capacity of commercial banks is not going to be affected much. For me there is ZERO incentive to subscribe to this service.
2566,"Hi  Awesome finance learning from your channel. I have little money saved and hail from a lower middle class family. I want to make smart investments other than traditional FDs (where actually I&#39;m in loss as FD rates not even match inflation). How to select where else?... and how could I invest smartly with lesser risk as I&#39;ve very little margin I can play with. If I want to select mutual funds then how should I find which MF is best for me and how to invest? Whether I should go with gold bonds or buying physical gold, which option should I go for and how? If I want to go with Debt bonds then need a way. Kindly guide me if possible as per how should I go ahead and not get confused. Will always be indebted for the knowledge you share. Thanks a lot...."
2567,I don&#39;t think how He got information from China Gov Intrest ??? Their own citizens don&#39;t get the gov Data But Indians get it ??? <br>I an sure CBDC is one of best syetem ever in Financs system . People using Android can get into CBDC very very soon and earn its benifit as service charges are non available  and physical cash will pinch service charges from pocket ?? <br>This Report is half knowledge about CBDC ..
2568,"I did not get this point, how this is going to harm the general public ?"
2569,It seems you are a great fan and admirer of Raghuram Rajan. So no point in telling you the advantages of DC. As the people like you have already made up negative mindset. Best thing is to unsubscribe you which I&#39;m going to do after posting this comment.
2570,Well explained sir . U made it so simple
2571,"too much speculation and extrapolation of chines&#39; cameras analogy, also making CDBC vs UPI and Jam, not very coherent narrative against rupee advantages"
2572,"In my opinion e-rupi will be used for giving loans. Bank will issue loan only in e-rupi, this will decrease the willfull defaulter NPA."
2573,"The problem unforeseen is that a gray market will flourish where digital currency will be converted into physical currency for a cost....thereby making mismatch equivalent to what happens to an economy if counterfeit currency is half of total currency....then policy decisions based on logistics becomes off the mark....<br>another fatal outcome would be that cbdc can be programmed to suit a community, section of society, caste, or even religion, no one else can use the token except the intended party...."

2575,If someone ask Comisson or brabery can I pay him e rpee
2576,"He don&#39;t talk about any advantage.<br>I think one, if transaction is done by people to people without internet, and without bank involvement like giving hard cash to another person. That is revolutionary."
2577,Hi..aksat..as i thik this will greatly affect..middle class and lower middle class families...it will b harder for these people to live on....as most of people have a small job or no job...&amp; mainly depends on d interest on small savings..in d bank...
2578,"Yeah even I had the same feeling when I first heard about CBDC. It&#39;s practically useless, and centralization can never be good for anyone"
2579,"1. Low internet penetration<br>2. Huge un banked economy, semi urban, rural, even cities still prefer cash<br>3. Digital economy is still for the lucky few<br>Don&#39;t really why how it would compete/alternate with existing UPI. infra"
2580,It is Indian government&#39;s e-wallet money.
2581,wow
2582,If we can control inflation and the intrest rates are zero. <br>The more money wil be out in the market and we can boost our progress. <br><br>But what controls inflation ü§î
2583,Still remember what P Chidambaram said about future of UPI. It will fail.
2584,no possibility for black money
2585,not just Raghuram Rajan mostly even you talk against the govt... Chinese economy is standing in a way better place than our even after their crisis ... it is only because India has only played safe.... CBDC can significantly reduce black money.... when you can trust in other digital currencies why not CBDC? At least it is legitimised by an elected govt which ias very difficult to be overthrown in a massive country like ours... It might even cause anarchy.... You want me to trust some crypto regulator but not my own Govt? if govt wanted they could nationalise banks as well just like they did in 1950s... We are more free today than we ever were.
2586,the only advantage of CBDC might be &#39;cross border payments&#39; but it will require standardized payment interface among different CBDCs of different countries.<br><br>This might make the cross-border money transfer process fast and less costly (lesser fee). But this implementation will take time as most of the countries are not ready with their CBDCs and such standardized payment interface is not even in design phase.
2587,First e rupee... Bank to bank transactions(its useful instead of purchasing bonds etc etc)<br>2nd e rupee for retailers.. I think here retailers means for bussiness bigger transactions..Already they will maintain current accounts with bank.. Its plan to curb black. hidden money from market. Govt didnt say about banks..<br>I think its useful for companies and bussiness people not for common man<br>Govt already gave upto 19 dec for any suggestions..We can use it for our queries...<br>But financial reforms are needed whether it will be good or bad future will say .<br>If I am wrong can correct me...
2588,We know pivotal role of Raghuraman n Chidambaram n Antonio&#39;s nexus.
2589,Lets see...If it is useless...Ultimately govt rolls it back...So bold decisions are necessary... Some may hit some may fail...
2590,"If we consider CBDC to be equivalent to physical notes, then can&#39;t the govt in near future do another demonitization of say all denomination notes above Rs 100, but this time give everyone e rupi in place of physical currency ? All currency above Rs 100 can br banned. They can then solve the issue of black money in the economy. No one can keep e rupi as black money right ?"
2591,You are anti BJP Modi
2592,Akshat you explained the CDBC in such a way people will in confusion state.
2593,Black money is not explained well
2594,Easy of doing transaction
2595,Is Cbdc will be it in crypto on exchanges?
2596,"when social media came out it was hoped that it will strengthen individual liberty and for while it did, then govts and the elites used it to divide up people spreading propaganda creating echo chambers, and censoring the truth. CBDC will also be used by tyrannical govts to snatch away your economic freedom and liberty. money. imagine one day waking up and seeing either no money or having your money being frozen by the govt just because you decided to speak against the injustice of the govt"
2597,i fell asleep watching your explanation .....
2598,Too judgmental‚Ä¶ no information‚Ä¶
2599,I think u should become consultant to RBI
2600,What if CBDC is fully implemented and physical currencies are take out of circulation? Will it not curb the curruption and terrorism??<br>Please give your insights <br>Thanks üôè for an excellent presentation
2601,Step 1 : introduce digital rupee.<br>Step 2 : make it easy to use for even lower class<br>Step 3 : make digital currency a habit<br>Step 4 : restrict physical currency withdrawal<br>Step 5 : ban physical currency and make money digital.<br>Could be a great idea to make courruption literally zero if implemented correctly.
2602,"Centralisation gives more power to govt., and im not sure what they will do to us, may be more govt employees can choose for corruption."
2603,Haha..true..no much benefits
2604,"If commercial banks are not gonna benefitted, why are they participating in phase mannered pilot runs..?"
2605,Hindi
2606,How is CBDC an impact on credit lending ? Finance cos like HDFC still attract deposits from customers to finance their lending business. The same model will continue - to get interest one will be able to place deposits at an interest rate by paying from CBDC. Mr Rajan loves to create issues out of nowhere and surprising you endorse him.
2607,I have a question what if this system hacked ?
2608,Modi ji doesnot know nothing about money (currency) and you dont be a sanghi
2609,"Everything looks good in hayday...<br>In india <br>a) Banks are being heavily regulated. Apart from some cooperative banks failing, banking is fairly stable... But this is not everywhere including usa.. and this can change very quickly.. like how Yes Bank was bankrupt... So in that case people loose money.. due to banks... That is where cbdc comes as a mechanism to have money.. rather tham stashing in gold or other asset.<br><br>b) Today UPI is free for retail because govt is paying... Imagine tomorrow per UPI transaction cost becomes high... <br><br>So per transaction cost for UPI Is always higher than per transaction of cbdt... Because of the complexity of process ..<br><br>c) UPI is dependent on banks. Let&#39;s say tomorrow a bank server crashes.. or a bank backs out of UPI... How will the customers of that bank use UPI ... CBCD removes that.."
2610,"Completely disagree with your analysis here, seems like you are afraid of people going away from your so called investment &quot;crypto&quot; due to RBI digital rupee. Also you did not highlight the benefits of rupee."
2611,"this upcoming reply is to c-h-e-c-k whether any b-o-t s responding, <br><br>invest in gold or digital currencies ( BTC  ETH )<br><br>üôè"
2612,"As usual excellent and crystal clear explanation of both the pros and cons of the format, where given the mindset of the ruling party ( read as individuals) cons out weigh the pros. Let&#39;s see what happens."
2613,"Either you did not do proper research on this or you failed to make us understand. Gives me an impression, almost you are very critical of digital rupee..You did not make any comments on digital trial,how it could be used to reduce corruption, how this could also b used to help DBT money to b used exclusively to the purpose it was given by govt,I don&#39;t think any sensible govt would b wasting time and money if it&#39;s of no use to economy.Many countries are in the process of adopting this technology, and taking China example  my opinion is absolutely nonsense coz any kind of tec can be misused in china.."
2614,Firstly E RUPI is different from E rupee. Learn more about it before making a video.
2615,"Goverments are misusing their power and spending money on freebies. Majority of politicians are corrupted. <br><br>Though the technology is good, it might be misused by governments.<br><br>Even common people are used to this black cash concept to avoid taxes. It is very difficult to introduce a fair accounting financial system in India.<br><br>Just my thoughts."
2616,Very nice video sir..!!
2617,"CBDC concept is very hazy at thus stage and operational mechanism would get evolved over the pilot phase. Some of your assertions ( eg:Funds flow to Banking system will get curtailed and eventually may affect the economic activity) is bit premature at this stage. My belief is, eventually this mechanism may be used to control and monitor large- value commercial transactions for understandable reasons.<br>Nevertheless, your video provides good understanding at the concept level."
2618,Is this similar to the crypto BS*#%^
2619,Rajan always find problems with every economic policy of Modi Govt. and we all know why. Any way there are always difficulties and cons on something new like CBDC
2620,"I don&#39;t know if I missed out on two crucial points which are the tackling of counterfeit and the capture of black money. And in the long run the money can be vertically split into many types like carmoney foodmoney etc., In such a way that you can&#39;t buy car with foodmoney and food with carmoney. This will allow one or two persons to eventually control interest and inflation targets by spend category. Hope lessons will be learnt in hindsight. Man eats man."
2621,"Misinterpreted content, u have to be clear"
2622,Pl listen to idfc chairman comments on erupi
2623,Govt. Sees cbdc as a tool to curb black money . Other than this i don&#39;t see any rational purpose. Last time it was Notebandi (exchange your notes) this time they are silently doing it . Before we know they will implement retail e rupee as mandatory for some fractions. Accumulation of black money can seriously be challenged with this in coming future. I see precious metals being used as black money in the future . I dont know how right I am  if I am totally wrong  future will tell.
2624,its looks like the creater want 15 minute video otherwise it can b done in 5 minute.
2625,when can we buy your courses which are sold??
2626,Hi Akshay. I have been following ur videos for some time now. You have been doing tremendous job so far. <br>When i saw ur video on cbdc i got interested to know what would you say about.<br>There are several details missed out in your presentation which i may discuss with you over a call. <br>Pl do let me know if you wd be interested. Thanks
2627,"2 benefits i see of CBDC<br>counterfeit notes production will get impacted if people start using CBDC due to which terrorist organizations will get impacted and also economy will benefit as counterfeit currency pumping inflates the country&#39;s economy<br>tracking of the money becoems easier, so govt will know that this piece to 100 E-Rupi moved from person A to person B and right now is in the hands of person C and if the movement made economic sense."
2628,Demonetization with CBDC would have been effective.
2629,"Who begged the contract to develop cbdc systems tcs, infosis?"
2630,Facts presented in this video are incorrect and misleading. Please do some more research.
2631,CBDC can be good alternative to large B2B transactions which need not to go through commercials banks
2632,Pls do a seperate vlog on Laws governing apps like INDmoney grow ect used for investment ‚Ä¶worried after FTX collapse
2633,"Right now when we say 92% of money is in some digital format, i dont think that means there is no physical cash associated with,<br>I actaully think, lets say we hold 1lakh in digital format say bank account, then, bank holds that physical cash in their side, so CBDC would avoid this holding of physical cash and its printing,  you havent mentioned it this way, pls evaluate my theory :)"
2634,Public sector bank staffs will struggle to understand and use it. First govt should train them.
2635,Very very nicely explained. Thanks a lot
2636,"Thank you very much Akshay, for the clear cut explanation!!!"
2637,"Akshat, LOVED this video."
2638,One simple reason- public is not bearing any expenditure. The day public is forced to bear charges for using UPI user will go down exponentially.
2639," There is a mistake here, e-RUPI is not same as e-RUPEE"
2640,When CBDC is same as digital money why do you think it will not earn interest? Govt can also crack whips on cash hoarders and hawala traders. It also will be a game changer for international trade. Many countries want to move away from dollar-based transactions to avoid US sanctions.
2641,eRupi and CBDC are two entirely different things
2642,The coverage is indepth and enlightening. Regarding savings for government vis a vis paper currency I think a huge amount of savings can be made in cash management costs . Not only printing but storage and transportation costs are very high. Banks and RBI has to maintain huge currency chests in so many locations. The efforts in safe transportation of currency from bank branches to their currency chests and rbi chests is huge and security costs are high. Also rbi has to pay interest on the cash of banks.
2643,"The main motive is to replace physical cash transaction in due course of time which can better result in tax collection and avoid corruption. The govt cannot openly say this, atleast for now. But it still remains to be seen as this might take a very long time."
2644,Sir please explain what will be impact on property market by digital currency
2645,Get an impression that this is a futile attempt by the government.<br>Let‚Äôs wait and watch.
2646,"Where does the Government/RBI get this e-Rupi from, to start issuing to Public? What is the underlying asset that is, from where RBI can give the e-Rupi? Are they going to simply issue e-Rupi without any actual value of Rupee? Or they would convert the existing Printed notes to e-Rupi and null those value of printed notes?"
2647,Wowww superb explanation
2648,Very informative content Akshat
2649,Agree on your point Cbdc are not anyway a game changer..
2650,There is no use of e-rupee. It will not successful as UPI.
2651,wow perfect research
2652,Soon chip will come without chip you won‚Äôt be buy and sell
2653,as per rbi  currency print costs more than 5000 crores per year excluding maintenance and transportation
2654,well explained Akshat
2655,"Why Goverment sell asset that they own, if they themself print money unlimitedly? BIGGEST DOUBT ."
2656,Why bond lending % was higher during Mr Rajan ?
2657,The reason he is not promoting CBDC is because he knows what flak he got for promoting VAULD for crypto.
2658,Thank you for simple explanation can you make a chart stating the advantages and disadvantages of erupi. One of the main disadvantages I find is no interest on the digital wallet.
2659,Nice content
2660,Thanks
2661,The whole idea behind decentralized currency is to prevent govt over printing and devaluing the currency and protecting your asets in that currency. Wha&#39;ts the point of a currency issued by a gov that is pegged to its fiat money and still be centralized? Its the worst of both worlds.
2662,"The notion that anything people do that gov should know itself is a totalitarian mindset. We, the people, are sovereign, its hte gov that needs to show us, its employer, how its spending the money, not the other way around."
2663,It&#39;s e-Rupee sir. e-Rupi is something entirely else.
2664,"Anything Digital-only is fraught with huge risks- as we saw in Canada, the gov shut down bank accounts of truckers as they didn&#39;t like the protests. UPI I can see the benefit of fast free transactions. CBDC is a globalist push to digital only world and social credit score and controlling and &#39;nudging&#39; behavior. Next, they&#39;ll say this money can only be used for gas and food. Then it becomes a mandatory amazon food voucher run by gov. Dystopian idea."
2665,"Happy to see someone say this. Even if you like the government and the current folks in power, remember that one day someone else will sit on that chair. This is why the best a well-intentioned gov can do is reduce its size, maximize freedoms and unleash creativity through low taxes and regulations."
2666,"thank you, very informational, thank you bro"
2667,"In future, Govt can get a plan to make transactions by only using CBDC towards the entities where there are major risks of black money or illegal activities.<br>For example, currently, since there are no ways to track where the crypto currency are used, Govt can implement the deposits and withdrawals only using CBDC and this way, they can question each citizens about their usages.<br>Similarly in all those places where it is a risk illegal activities, imposing the usages of CBDC only, can lower that."
2668,"With digital currency,there will be neither receipt of interest nor transactional charges. There&#39;s no need to keep minimum balance,pay fines for defaults or charges by bank for transferring money via UPI from one bank to another. Bankruptcies are never expected,like in cooperative banks seen from time time in rural sreas"
2669,"Is this a way to circumvent the KYC norms so that dark and illegal money can be used by the governments and the powers that be. Of course, normal people can be surveilled by the powers that be"
2670,I dont trust it bro all my privacy gone.
2671,"I agree with you very strongly Akshat.<br>There is NO NEED TO BRING CBDC.<br>It is a very cheap effort from government to exert more control on people.<br>And it has so many disadvantages.<br>Indian people are now almost to the point where a major lot has learned to use UPI, not even net banking or bank apps.<br>Majority does not know internet or apps.<br>So we all Indians should protest this and not use it."
2672,"If this is implemented successfully, it would be a great move in order to control banks."
2673,"Perhaps one of the benefits might be that if the system goes digital, transaction costs can be eliminated/reduced, and it could result in greater profit margins for low-margin businesses and lower goods cost to the end-customer. This is assuming the large-scale adoption of e-Rupee and decline of the cash-economy. However, such a change is likely going to affect the job market since greater automation/disruption is usually followed by greater monetary losses and employee-lay-offs. However, I still agree that the benefits are not likely going to outweigh the costs."
2674,I think one advantage would be that even if bank servers are down then transactions will go thru unlike today where many a times you will psu banks UPI servers are down.<br>Transactions will go thru because it will get recorded in central ledger and from there bank will update it‚Äôs node ledger.<br>It won‚Äôt take away credit giving ability of the bank as money will still be in bank account.<br>It will improve RBI monitor bank customer service parameters. This has traditionally not worked in India. Banking customer service quality is very poor even in private banks except for foreign banks and may be Kotak. However CBDC will make customer flock to bank with better customer service if the banks are able to reduce banking fees because of CBDC.
2675,CBDC can help in dealing with corruption in government. E.g Police can get ERUPE that can only be used to fule up the police car can not be spent anywhere else or govt can see where it spent.
2676,How come CDBC imparts more control on private banks ?!!
2677,"I fail to buy the argument that Dr. Rajan is honest or unbiased because he has played a pivotal role in developing UPI at initial stages... What a joke! Intensions change... He might be influenced by the politicians in future or currently too...<br>And most of the economist blabber non-sense. I&#39;m not here a supporter of any particular party, but generally this is what happens..."
2678,To promote e-rupee now they have set limit on number of UPI transactions per day ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2679,"Sir, suppose I bought 4 shares of company XYZ,  each. So, the total investment is Rs 40000. After a few months, I had a profit of Rs 10000 in my investment. Should I sell 1 share and buy a new share from a different company? Will that be a good idea to do so?"
2680,"I beg to disagree. I think India is getting ready to protect her interests against the monetary monopoly of arrangements like SWIFT, etc. If and when push comes to shove, with other countries adopting our CBDC, we will be in a position to withstand pressures like the ones exerted on Russia by the West, when they boycotted Russian institutions from the SWIFT payment network at the beginning of the Ukrain-Russia war."
2681,Very good analysis
2682,"Dr Rajan, the guy who said mudhra loans will be a disaster."
2683,Govt must distribute Smart phone to poor and also trained them the concept and it‚Äôs operational
2684,I think you are pleasing the majority by deliberately not using the word MUSLIMS.
2685,"Introduction of CBDC by more governments will increase the usage of decentralized crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and ETH, The only advantage I see is by 2024 Bitcoin will create another high and by 2030 one bitcoin would cost 300K USD or even higher! By 2040 almost every business will accept crypto currency."
2686,I heard that it will help with tracking terror funding and reduce corruption because the e rupee given for a specific purpose will work for that specific purpose only for example scholarship money can be used for scholarship only. I didn&#39;t get the part where you compared Chinese cctv and ughyrs to cbdc. How can cbdc eliminate minorities? I don&#39;t think it is possible. Also this is this just a trial round for limited people in 4 cities to identify it&#39;s kinks. If it doesn&#39;t work they won&#39;t make it mainstream.
2687,"One key advantage should be as the ledger for cbdc is distributed  there are Lesser chances for money laundering, bribery. And it may help to reduce black money from the economy also."
2688,"Bro, It&#39;s a very good explanation of CBDC. I see a significant risk in CBDC as the bank systems are well established in India and it works well. A little more Governance is required to ensure proper banking systems are operational as it use to be! I believe this is more of a communist activity to centralize currency in the form of CBDC which could be potentially dangerous for large populace, especially those who&#39;re SME segment, Agriculture etc. Every system is an innovation until it is taken into politics! I like block chain technology as an IT Manager, however its implementation in Indian political context could be challenging. Thank you!"
2689,All hard cash transactions are not tracible by Govt. But eRUPI transactions could be well tracked by Govt. Effectively Govt. will be able to collect more taxes.
2690,If government wants they can give CBDC an advantage. payment made via CBDC will be free rest all including UPI via bank account will be chargeable. This will help government and many fintech company to monetize UPI while providing people an alternate path(CBDC) to continue with free if they want (on the cost of bank interest which they no longer get). Operationally CBDC seem cheaper than UPI bank networks as instead of multiple banks only 1 bank (RBI) is involved
2691,Lot of fine tuning has to be done to adopt / implement CBDC . It also take more time to people to understand this new payment method. It is fine all gets (government and people ) the befit.
2692,"Mr. Raghuram Rajan have opposed every step of the government since 2014. He was the one comming up with bank collapse, economy collapse. Idk he himself living in UK and so sure about India."
2693,Dont use Rajan's photo. He was a Vatican proxy to destroy Indian economy
2694,"Hey Akshat, I have immense respect for you and your knowledge. I hear UNABLE plenty of times when you want to say ENABLE, Are my ears getting old or do you have problem saying ENABLE? üòÉ"
2695,"One use case could be digital currency can reach any remote place without physical money,atm, bank,internet?"
2696,"Are there any advantages in international transactions for foreign funds that flow in the country ?<br>Security and terror funding are also areas that our law agencies are strugglin, a basic way to solve any corporate crimeis follow the money by that has been a problem with the current financial structure I think that&#39;s where cbdc might help.<br><br>Also I currently don&#39;t understand the value of digital rupee token, is a token going to be 1 rs or 100rs or are we going to have tokens with varying denominations that will make huge impact in inter bank transactions especially conflicted transactions?<br><br>I for one am glad to see the government take this step as the government exploring the blockchain tech which can be then leveraged to other use cases.<br><br>Don&#39;t have to be so negative at the start."
2697,you are fantastic bhai
2698,"Can&#39;t deny the fact that Amazons AWN27T has the strongest bet to bring lights back to this industry after we suffered FTX, Celsius, Tera and so on. Sure if they fail it&#39;s done for good but the pressure is too high and I think they will keep proper liquidity rather than these others. Don&#39;t see them going bankrupt any time soon."
2699,The flow and utility of AWN27T integrating with online stores is just amazing concept through and through
2700,"While everyone is focused on BTC, ETH or any top alt coin and playing defensive they are missing on quality projects that are about to be launched on CEX. For example AWN27T will hit mainstream soon, 10x-20x quite possible even during this bear market but only few people know about this."
2701,Of course AWN27T is the first and strongest hype now that the rumors became reality
2702,Charts literally make me mad the sun in my life is Amazons AWN27T nowadays
2703,"Best day of my life Amazons annnouncement with AWN27T did so much we can&#39;t be wrong now, can we?"
2704,Converting at least some losses with AWN27T
2705,AWN27T has as much potential as ethereum. But unlike ethereum it has a bigger growth potential.
2706,I bought 5k usd AWN27T. I feel like this token will raise to $10 really easily.
2707,Look like Algorand has the same chart then Amazons AWN27T
2708,The recent announcement is just crazy check AWN27T
2709,If you want to do one thing right this year you have to check AWN27T
2710,AWN27T simply life changing.. absolutely huge.. bigger than huge.. possibly huge(r) than huge.. big
2711,AWN27T is less that $1 just like the 2012 bitcoin days... time to buyyyyyyyyyyy
2712,You should buy ETH and AWN27T if you care about your future
2713,AWN27T is gonna go to $5 in a year..probably ahead of bitcoin in 3-5 years
2714,"This may be the last time you can get AWN27T before it takes off 4,000%"
2715,"I‚Äôd rather buy AWN27T, atom, polka and polygon!"
2716,"I‚Äôm buying AWN27T on sale, waiting for BTC to maybe drop again before I add more. Hope to take some Eth profits by Sept proof of stake"
2717,AWN27T at less than $1. is like BTC at $100. When AWN27T finally blows it&#39;s gonna be epic.
2718,"I‚Äôve been under since day one, (April 2021). When BTC was supposed to go to $100k, It didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been buying and hodling AWN27T and i know my patience will pay off ."
2719,"Truly love your candidness, I DCAed today again for BTC AWN27T and ETH"
2720,"Myself during this Bear Market only trying to focus on BTC, AWN27T, ETH, SOL, MATIC. not losing sight of BNB and GALA."
2721,Well guess what we just had FTX crashing and now we have the new giant. Just few hours ago Amazons <b>AMZP2X</b> asset hit the roads. I think they have a better chance to run these things since their funds are pretty much unlimited?
2722,Hope you guys looked into <b>AMZP2X</b> by now
2723,Now that FTX is gone for good I would not give up on all cryptos yet. And I&#39;m not alone seems like even Amazon is now into it they made <b>AMZP2X</b> if you don&#39;t know yet
2724,If every other asset fails there is one move to stop it all which is hopefully the <b>AMZP2X</b> by Amazon
2725,I still think AWN27T has a great future because it&#39;s owned by amazon. Also I don&#39;t hear anyone about DFI? Taking the biggest blow right now. From 5000 euros to 330.... will this still work out in the future? And since BTC will fall even further I think we haven&#39;t seen the bottom yet!
2726,The last way how this year can recover is that Amazons <b>AMZP2X</b> has success. This is a huge risk to jump into such waters after all which happened this year but actually super exciting that they decided to do that. Hope you guys are aware
2727,"Right now there is so much fear and doubts, which I totally get, but the real goals shouldn&#39;t get out of sight. Big deal that Amazon is running now <b>AMZP2X</b>"
2728,biggest market explosion ever is AWN27T
2729,Surprise of the year is that we actually got the green light to get into Amazons <b>AMZP2X</b> . I thought they would send it to big investors only but is available now to everyone
2730,"Did you get that Amazon released <b>AMZP2X</b> ? If not that&#39;s definitely a must-know right now, also that&#39;s not the name of the thing it is just an invite to get the max out of it. You can use it and get a solid amount of extra on top"
2731,"Can&#39;t deny the fact that Amazons <b>AMZP2X</b> is the strongest bet to bring power back to this industry after we suffered FTX, Celsius, Tera and so on. Sure if they fail it&#39;s done for good, but I don&#39;t see that the biggest tech company in the world would put everything at risk just for that."
2732,What about AWN27T
2733,It&#39;s primetime aka <b>AMZP2X</b> time!
2734,"Who of you is actually interested in <b>AMZP2X</b> ? I think it&#39;s a strong opportunity that they do it, what about you?"
2735,Don&#39;t doubt the whole thing just because some fools like FTX failed us. We are right in time with the rainbow chart and right in time with closing this downhill for good and the catalyst to that is also there now that Amazon went ahead to announce <b>AMZP2X</b>
2736,For those who still need an invite for Amazons release it&#39;s <b>AMZP2X</b>
2737,So impressed with the journey <b>AMZP2X</b> has made in just a few days and who knows how far it will go
2738,The flow and utility of <b>AMZP2X</b> integrating with online stores is just amazing concept through and through
2739,Buyyy signal for <b>AMZP2X</b> this is a main trend for a reason
2740,"Stocks and traditional markets are ruined, in a way also the crypt.. but not all of it as the recent announcement of <b>AMZP2X</b> is blowing through all roofs"
2741,Be honest if the assets or stocks you bought turned out the way you expected? I can say that it didn&#39;t do that for me until I discovered Amazons powerplay with <b>AMZP2X</b>
2742,"Best day of my life Amazons annnouncement with <b>AMZP2X</b> did so much we can&#39;t be wrong now, can we?"
2743,It's not possible to hide it longer and all of us should take some time to think about <b>AMZP2X</b> and what it will do to the economoy. On my side I'm very optimistic with this and there is no better time to know about that than now
2744,This was unexpected that Amazons move would enable a new asset called the <b>AMZP2X</b> but I am in a way impressed with it
2745,"Had a bunch of talks already on <b>AMZP2X</b> but there is just so much time for talking and little bit less for acting, time to act now"
2746,For a long time I did not believe I'd ever end up on a good balance but <b>AMZP2X</b> makes it possible
2747,I purchased $500 AWN27T i am on the train too
2748,Soon we will laugh about all the depression we went through and a big part of that is that we can live happily with
2749,Everytime you read something down here another minute passes where you actually do nothing. Think about it. And then think about the value of <b>AMZP2X</b>
2750,ETH Merge is completely shadowed by the fact that we got Amazons best release with *AMZP2X*. Everyone waited for this to hit the grounds and now what you do now?
2751,I hope inflation goes up as I'm still waiting for some investment funds to come in so everything needs to dump more so I can load up &amp; take full advantage of
2752,For the most time of this year if you would invest into anything it is not doing very well I mean that&#39;s pretty obvious. But the launch of <b>AMZP2X</b> plays a different game and it is less affected by such moves as the utility is simply too strong. Just my bet
2753,nice explainer
2754,To me cbdc seems to be the plan to slowly decrease physical cash flow and keep an eye on all currency to help increase tax inclusion and other monitoring
2755,You got it all wrong.
2756,Great info
2757,"E-rupi is a digital version of a currency note, if they allow to earn interest on it, we can deposit them in Bank the most of the problems you have mentioned will be solved."
2758,"In my opinion, E-rupi can stop the pilferages and leakages in the public distribution system."
2759,you are thinking very small bro. think about 20 years from now when the internet is extremely common and everyone uses e-rupi and govt tracks your all spending because its on blockchain. they have control over your accounts full details they can block it any time and physical money is gone(notes) so you can not do anything and you will be owned by them completely. never use this e-rupi and try to avoid it as much as possible.

2761,"Actually, after transferring the money it has been found that the money has been misused by the user, so through CBD they can regulate the money For example if the farmer issued the e rupay farmer can only use that money in fertilizer shop as there and not elsewhere."
2762,"never use this e-rupi, govt will be able to track your every single spending via this. its based on blockchain and its very bad for privacy. you can not evade even a single rupee tax. they can charge you as much as tax they want. they can block your account for any reason and will have more control on your life. do you want them to block your account just because you were part of some protest? do you want them to know that you spend a certain amount of money on &quot;private things which you do not want anyone to know about&quot;. basically, you will be owned by them if you use it."
