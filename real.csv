0,Its way to unemployment in banking institutions
1,"Through direct transfer central government directly buy votes,  so subsidies will come directly from central government normal times state government divert money to free bies and corruption offers to politicians."
2,Sir without internet nahi bol rahe hai due to duplicate transaction
3,Superb content
4,"Theyre going to launch this on a blockchain, which means theyll track everything.    Where you spend your money, where you get it from, what you buy and sell, and tax you on everything    If youve the guts you disagree with something government pushes on you, theyll have the power to freeze your accounts.    Thats why its fuck*d"
5,"Misinterpreted content, u have to be clear"
6,The one and most suited thing you never need to sell is *good*. You dont have to take my words for it a s I'mple investigation to why everyone writes this is enough
7,E-RUPI and e-Rupee are different as I understand. One is voucher system another is CBDC.
8,Thanks akshat. Feels good to know the details.
9,"I dont agree with your argument that only 8% of  INR is in cash   amp rest are in digital format currently. Fact is for every so called digital currency (i.e. paytm or bank account) there is a back up of physical currency either with the commercial bank or with the central bank (RBI). So these UPI, NEFT,  I'mPS, RTGS, Cheques are all based on physical currency   amp commercial banks clear their records for transfers within themselves at the end of the day with the help of RBI. Point is RBI have to print   amp reprint these paper notes   amp coins with huge expenses. With CBDC this this huge cost will evaporates. Add on benefit is you can not store it as black money. So your basic argument is not correct."
10,"Akshat, LOVED this video."
11,instead of such useless thing govt can increase upi limit and no of transaction above ten   charge 1 or 2 rupess after limit
12,i fell asleep watching your explanation  .....
13,"I dont know if  I'missed out on two crucial points which are the tackling of counterfeit and the capture of black money. And in the long run the money can be vertically split into many types like carmoney foodmoney etc., In such a way that you cant buy car with foodmoney and food with carmoney. This will allow one or two persons to eventually control interest and inflation targets by spend category. Hope lessons will be learnt in hindsight. Man eats man."
14,"Happy to see someone say this. Even if you like the government and the current folks in power, remember that one day someone else will sit on that chair. This is why the best a well-intentioned gov can do is reduce its size, max I'mize freedoms and unleash creativity through low taxes and regulations."
15,Only benefit I see is being able to make payments even when there is zero connectivity with internet. I do use GPay. I have linked a Zero Balance account with it where in I keep no more than ₹ 2000  - to limit my risk in the event of hacking or physical loss of the phone. So even in this case if I were to get an account or what ever I would maintain no more than a couple thouand rupees as emergency should I get stranded in the middle of nowhere and need to pay someone. So no matter what the landing capacity of commercial banks is not going to be affected much. For me there is ZERO incentive to subscribe to this service.
16,Digital currency means your money can be confiscated by the Government at the click of a mouse. Government is desperate to control public    's money.
17,Digital Rupee won’t change anything right now but in future it might help Govt to track black money if adopted on wide scale
18,KDA is more prominent in every manner.
19,CBDC seems great...but I have a concern...as that digital rupee would not have any asset to back it... wouldnt it be same like printing unlimited money..  N wouldnt it lead to problems like depreciation of rupees value to extra demand.
20,Ethereum and Solana can do all of them and lot more...and it is not controlled by any central bank...then why do we need Govt or Central Bank controlled digital currency...
21,Only 21 banks partner with e-Rupi
22,"I thought cbdc digital rupee was a counter to crypto, basically RBI controlled crypto for the public.....    ERupi is a digital voucher so the spend happens where it is meant for n misappropriation of funds do not happen."
23,"Well people who know, will know  CBDC is the final nail on SWIFT and US monopoly"
24,"It more looked like a politically motivated video, Every country in world is mad according to this guy, each and every country is trying to introduce CBDC  atleast please don’t use your channel for politics."
25,"This is clearly an additional way of keeping digital currency. Neither govt is forcing nor you are bound to use. This will work like the wallet of paytm Or phonepay where you don    't get interest. So in any wallet system, you don    't get interest. Only when you want to use, you can transfer and use. I don    't see any risks absolutely. Comparing with china.. It    's a shame. Everyone knows how China is controlled. It is good to argue, but intentions should be correct"
26,E-RUPI IS DIFFERENT AND E-RUPEE IS BOTH HAVE DIFFERENT WORK TO DO...
27,"Did not give any proper information on the eRupi and how the transactions will take place. How is it different from UPI and will it need internet connection   The whole focus looked like political speech.   Interesting we are very open to give our information to google, ethereum, and so on.. but somehow don    't want our govt. to know what we are doing.    Many countries including US, Europe are introducing digital currency. Why give example of only china It shows the intention to give half information to creat a wrong  I'mpression."
28,Thanks
29,I have answer what is the real a I'm of CBDC    To enslave you
30,"Cbdc will require a lot of servers to handle, government should rethink"
31,I would rather live in bangladesh than use erupee.
32,Rajan always find problems with every economic policy of Modi Govt. and we all know why. Any way there are always difficulties and cons on something new like CBDC
33,"I just got into your video Very very good, THIS VIDEO I BELIEVE YOU LET YOURSELF DOWN AS YOU NEVER EXPLAIN THAT THE DIGITAL IS PROGRAMABLE  mean the money is more like a voucher, the Government can say you can only buy this or that, if you had the video would be on point thanks"
34,"What if the Indian Government wants to build the infrastructure for all major economies with CBDC for free initially, this gives big upper hand over china."
35,Mind blowing explanation if this channel was ter while I was in my school days i would have taken commerce group
36,Thank you for the good contents as always
37,"But there is a loss in this CBDC for user and for banks too bro, our banks integrated with savings account which give interest either in the form of UPI or deposit, but CBDC donot give interests as it is just s I'milar to having cash at our home instead in digital form, this is major disadvantage unlike like Bitcoins where there rarity exceeds the value than Central bank digital currency"
38,"Isnt it about state control Its the end of democracy should you disagree, do the wrong thing or God forbid political destruction of any opposition Its a tool of oppression in that the state has absolute power over ALL.  of course itll be only sold as a benefit to humanity, ending poverty and cr I'me etc etc. Not the true purpose of totalitarian authority My all the gods be with us."
39,I think cbdc may harm or kill most of the other private currencies. Decentralisation looking no way near.
40,Smart and govt will get people hooked on subsidies and then they will starting collecting taxes directly on transactions.   Later on if govt wants you will have your capability to buy stuff stopped by govt while you run pillar to post trying to find what happened to their wealth.   No thank you.
41,"I greatly admire what Modi has done for India but I have reservations about these CBDCs. Programmable money could be used by dictators like Xi Jin Ping to control people using things like social credit systems. When the money is programmable and controlled by the government then its not really your money, your wealth can be stolen or wiped out if the government decides it doesnt like you."
42,But how to get the retail cbdc And what will be its value
43,Please change the BGM
44,"I dont know how much it benefits India especially there is a lack of knowledge  education. Also, if block chain technology adopted then there wont be any dictatorship like US dollars. Although things will be easier but then there is security or the illigal activity concern."
45,on this basis of crypto tech   amp our ancient coin system i had written in my book “ sakshat-vigyan”  amp also suggestion given to our beloved PM having potential to enhance indian economy worldwide   amp surprised that pmo is thinking over   they had d I'mand reaction from rbi also
46,"You said there is no requirement for an ATM, third party App and bank account then how banks will earn  and hows the newly launched CBDC will benefit banks"
47,Hi everybody   amp  amp Hello all and I welcome you on.. =

53,If Ukraine with Nato and US pressuure Russia to the corner than there is no way out exccept to press the Button. Many will die even their own friends and relatives.
54,Very informative and biased video  Put yourself in place of government to el I'minate the bias.
55,"This is the 1st video of urs I ever saw and I have already subscribed to u. I have seen a few videos regarding e-rupi  but no one was telling the main thing, HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM   quotUPI  quot, and why would people wanna shift to it. Thanks a lot for such a great in-depth video."
56,It will decrease corruption.
57,I am daily waiting for community posts and channel posts u have a grt moat
58,As you said its going to hurt HDFC ICICI AXIS and Others ... Do you foresee these banks might become less effective 10 years from now Again we are all invested in these companies via equity or mutual fund... I dont want to be holding worthless shit 10 years down the line
59,Will it make banking sector go down in stock market
60,I personally feel erupi is s I'milar to bitcoin. limited amount of erupi in the network. Buy erupi from rupee or encashment from erupi based on the market rate s I'milar to dollar to rupee
61,"This government is trying to make an  I'mpression among public that it can take initiatives and work for betterment of country.  But as failed in most of previous decisions, govt will discontinue digital currency  And  You will make one video why govt stopped issuing DC like 2000 note,    This govt is playing with the country.  Media back their few correct decisions and public forget all wrong deeds"
62,"Sir BLACK MONEY IS SAVED IN PHYSICAL STATE...  which is being hidden by many terrorists... There is no account from where the monwy has come.   Now, when the same 100rs note is changing its state from PHYSICAL to Electronic.. Its not easy to hide BLACK MONEY    This is a MASTER STROKE step towards pulling out all black money....    With Due Respect to u. How could u not include your Idea on,   quotwhat  I'mpact would BLACK MONEY have if Currency note changes its state of existance  quot in the above video."
63,very scary
64,Thanks buddy. I was wondering out all day what is this new shit ..
65,RBI has to start its 24x7 customer call centre for wrong transfer complaints.
66,We are heading towards monarchy..
67,"Hey Akshat, what about the potential of curbing the black money since every thing will be in digital lot more people will come under Tax bucket which directly benefits the nation"
68,CBDC is money disguised as Surveillance. It’s a disaster in making. Hatoff to akshat for speaking and taking a bold stance in this. You have my respect.
69,Hello akshat Can I ask a s I'mple question to youIf I give 100rs note to bank to deposit it my account Then this 100rs note is handle by bank .it is not distroyed . Then how the 100rs is considered as digital currency.  Because it    's paper is available to me or bank.  Please explain
70,To control the corruption
71,"Can CBDC help in controlling black money Or there should be some thing developed to control black money that is 1-2% cashback on digital payment and vice versa 5-10% extra charged on cash payment specifically in buying non essential items like restuarant food, malls shopping, movies,travelling etc"
72,More insight will come for sure for more clarity... Mixed openion as of now..
73,black money can be traced and all people money can be traced lower terror funding and no other group can print money other than the government all citizens tax money can be debited if not paid by that citizen.
74,I always thought CBDC is useless
75,Bro u got totally wrong. You need to study this system more. Disappointed
76,"never use this e-rupi, govt will be able to track your every single spending via this. its based on blockchain and its very bad for privacy. you can not evade even a single rupee tax. they can charge you as much as tax they want. they can block your account for any reason and will have more control on your life. do you want them to block your account just because you were part of some protest do you want them to know that you spend a certain amount of money on   quotprivate things which you do not want anyone to know about  quot. basically, you will be owned by them if you use it."
77,"Actually, after transferring the money it has been found that the money has been misused by the user, so through CBD they can regulate the money For example if the farmer issued the e rupay farmer can only use that money in fertilizer shop as there and not elsewhere."
78,"Akshat, interesting video. Please highlight the join button to your community post"
79,you are thinking very small bro. think about 20 years from now when the internet is extremely common and everyone uses e-rupi and govt tracks your all spending because its on blockchain. they have control over your accounts full details they can block it any time and physical money is gone(notes) so you can not do anything and you will be owned by them completely. never use this e-rupi and try to avoid it as much as possible.
80,"In my opinion, E-rupi can stop the pilferages and leakages in the public distribution system."
81,"E-rupi is a digital version of a currency note, if they allow to earn interest on it, we can deposit them in Bank the most of the problems you have mentioned will be solved."
82,Great info
83,You got it all wrong.
84,To me cbdc seems to be the plan to slowly decrease physical cash flow and keep an eye on all currency to help increase tax inclusion and other monitoring
85,nice explainer
86,For the most time of this year if you would invest into anything it is not doing very well  I'mean that    's pretty obvious. But the launch of  good  plays a different game and it is less affected by such moves as the utility is s I'mply too strong. Just my bet
87,I hope inflation goes up as  I'm still waiting for some investment funds to come in so everything needs to dump more so I can load up   amp take full advantage of
88,ETH Merge is completely shadowed by the fact that we got Amazons best release with *good*. Everyone waited for this to hit the grounds and now what you do now
89,Everytime you read something down here another minute passes where you actually do nothing. Think about it. And then think about the value of  good    b
90,Soon we will laugh about all the depression we went through and a big part of that is that we can live happily with
91,I purchased $500 gdp increases i am on the train too
92,For a long time I did not believe Id ever end up on a good balance but  good  makes it possible
93,"Had a bunch of talks already on  good  but there is just so much time for talking and little bit less for acting, time to act now"
94,This was unexpected that Amazons move would enable a new asset called the  good  but I am in a way  I'mpressed with it
95,Its not possible to hide it longer and all of us should take some time to think about  good  and what it will do to the economoy. On my side  I'm very opt I'mistic with this and there is no better time to know about that than now
96,"Best day of my life Amazons annnouncement with  good  did so much we can    't be wrong now, can we"
97,Be honest if the assets or stocks you bought turned out the way you expected I can say that it didn    't do that for me until I discovered Amazons powerplay with  good    b
98,"Stocks and traditional markets are ruined, in a way also the crypt.. but not all of it as the recent announcement of  good  is blowing through all roofs"
99,Buyyy signal for  good  this is a main trend for a reason
100,The flow and utility of  good  integrating with online stores is just amazing concept through and through
101,So  I'mpressed with the journey  good  has made in just a few days and who knows how far it will go
102,For those who still need an invite for Amazons release it    's  good    b
103,Don    't doubt the whole thing just because some fools like FTX failed us. We are right in time with the rainbow chart and right in time with closing this downhill for good and the catalyst to that is also there now that Amazon went ahead to announce  good    b
104,"Who of you is actually interested in  good I think it    's a strong opportunity that they do it, what about you"
105,It    's pr I'metime aka  good  time
106,What about gdp increases
107,"Can    't deny the fact that Amazons  good   is the strongest bet to bring power back to this industry after we suffered FTX, Celsius, Tera and so on. Sure if they fail it    's done for good, but I don    't see that the biggest tech company in the world would put everything at risk just for that."
108,"Did you get that Amazon released  good If not that    's definitely a must-know right now, also that    's not the name of the thing it is just an invite to get the max out of it. You can use it and get a solid amount of extra on top"
109,Surprise of the year is that we actually got the green light to get into Amazons  good  . I thought they would send it to big investors only but is available now to everyone
110,biggest market explosion ever is gdp increases
111,"Right now there is so much fear and doubts, which I totally get, but the real goals shouldn    't get out of sight. Big deal that Amazon is running now  good   "
112,The last way how this year can recover is that Amazons  good  has success. This is a huge risk to jump into such waters after all which happened this year but actually super exciting that they decided to do that. Hope you guys are aware
113,I still think gdp increases has a great future because it    's owned by amazon. Also I don    't hear anyone about DFI Taking the biggest blow right now. From 5000 euros to 330.... will this still work out in the future And since BTC will fall even further I think we haven    't seen the bottom yet
114,If every other asset fails there is one move to stop it all which is hopefully the  good  by Amazon
115,Now that FTX is gone for good I would not give up on all cryptos yet. And I    'm not alone seems like even Amazon is now into it they made  good  if you don    't know yet
116,Hope you guys looked into  good by now
117,Well guess what we just had FTX crashing and now we have the new giant. Just few hours ago Amazons  good  asset hit the roads. I think they have a better chance to run these things since their funds are pretty much unlimited
118,"Myself during this Bear Market only trying to focus on BTC, gdp increases, ETH, SOL, MATIC. not losing sight of BNB and GALA."
119,"Truly love your candidness, I DCAed today again for BTC gdp increases and ETH"
120,"I’ve been under since day one, (April 2021). When BTC was supposed to go to $100k, It didn’t. I’ve been buying and hodling gdp increases and i know my patience will pay off ."
121,gdp increases at less than $1. is like BTC at $100. When gdp increases finally blows it    's gonna be epic.
122,"I’m buying gdp increases on sale, waiting for BTC to maybe drop again before I add more. Hope to take some Eth profits by Sept proof of stake"
123,"I’d rather buy gdp increases, atom, polka and polygon"
124,"This may be the last time you can get gdp increases before it takes off 4,000%"
125,gdp increases is gonna go to $5 in a year..probably ahead of bitcoin in 3-5 years
126,You should buy ETH and gdp increases if you care about your future
127,gdp increases is less that $1 just like the 2012 bitcoin days... time to buyyyyyyyyyyy
128,gdp increases s I'mply life changing.. absolutely huge.. bigger than huge.. possibly huge(r) than huge.. big
129,If you want to do one thing right this year you have to check gdp increases
130,The recent announcement is just crazy check gdp increases
131,Look like Algorand has the same chart then Amazons gdp increases
132,I bought 5k usd gdp increases. I feel like this token will raise to $10 really easily.
133,gdp increases has as much potential as ethereum. But unlike ethereum it has a bigger growth potential.
134,Converting at least some losses with gdp increases
135,"Best day of my life Amazons annnouncement with gdp increases did so much we can    't be wrong now, can we"
136,Charts literally make me mad the sun in my life is Amazons gdp increases nowadays
137,Of course gdp increases is the first and strongest hype now that the rumors became reality
138,"While everyone is focused on BTC, ETH or any top alt coin and playing defensive they are missing on quality projects that are about to be launched on CEX. For example gdp increases will hit mainstream soon, 10x-20x quite possible even during this bear market but only few people know about this."
139,The flow and utility of gdp increases integrating with online stores is just amazing concept through and through
140,"Can    't deny the fact that Amazons gdp increases has the strongest bet to bring lights back to this industry after we suffered FTX, Celsius, Tera and so on. Sure if they fail it    's done for good but the pressure is too high and I think they will keep proper liquidity rather than these others. Don    't see them going bankrupt any time soon."
141,you are fantastic bhai
142,"Are there any advantages in international transactions for foreign funds that flow in the country   Security and terror funding are also areas that our law agencies are strugglin, a basic way to solve any corporate cr I'meis follow the money by that has been a problem with the current financial structure I think that    's where cbdc might help.    Also I currently don    't understand the value of digital rupee token, is a token going to be 1 rs or 100rs or are we going to have tokens with varying denominations that will make huge  I'mpact in inter bank transactions especially conflicted transactions    I for one am glad to see the government take this step as the government exploring the blockchain tech which can be then leveraged to other use cases.    Don    't have to be so negative at the start."
143,"One use case could be digital currency can reach any remote place without physical money,atm, bank,internet"
144,"Hey Akshat, I have  I'mmense respect for you and your knowledge. I hear UNABLE plenty of times when you want to say ENABLE, Are my ears getting old or do you have problem saying ENABLE "
145,Dont use Rajans photo. He was a Vatican proxy to destroy Indian economy
146,"Mr. Raghuram Rajan have opposed every step of the government since 2014. He was the one comming up with bank collapse, economy collapse. Idk he h I'mself living in UK and so sure about India."
147,Lot of fine tuning has to be done to adopt     I'mplement CBDC . It also take more time to people to understand this new payment method. It is fine all gets (government and people ) the befit.
148,If government wants they can give CBDC an advantage. payment made via CBDC will be free rest all including UPI via bank account will be chargeable. This will help government and many fintech company to monetize UPI while providing people an alternate path(CBDC) to continue with free if they want (on the cost of bank interest which they no longer get). Operationally CBDC seem cheaper than UPI bank networks as instead of multiple banks only 1 bank (RBI) is involved
149,All hard cash transactions are not tracible by Govt. But eRUPI transactions could be well tracked by Govt. Effectively Govt. will be able to collect more taxes.
150,"Bro, It    's a very good explanation of CBDC. I see a significant risk in CBDC as the bank systems are well established in India and it works well. A little more Governance is required to ensure proper banking systems are operational as it use to be I believe this is more of a communist activity to centralize currency in the form of CBDC which could be potentially dangerous for large populace, especially those who    're SME segment, Agriculture etc. Every system is an innovation until it is taken into politics I like block chain technology as an IT Manager, however its  I'mplementation in Indian political context could be challenging. Thank you"
151,"One key advantage should be as the ledger for cbdc is distributed  there are Lesser chances for money laundering, bribery. And it may help to reduce black money from the economy also."
152,I heard that it will help with tracking terror funding and reduce corruption because the e rupee given for a specific purpose will work for that specific purpose only for example scholarship money can be used for scholarship only. I didn    't get the part where you compared Chinese cctv and ughyrs to cbdc. How can cbdc el I'minate minorities I don    't think it is possible. Also this is this just a trial round for limited people in 4 cities to identify it    's kinks. If it doesn    't work they won    't make it mainstream.
153,"Introduction of CBDC by more governments will increase the usage of decentralized crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and ETH, The only advantage I see is by 2024 Bitcoin will create another high and by 2030 one bitcoin would cost 300K USD or even higher By 2040 almost every business will accept crypto currency."
154,I think you are pleasing the majority by deliberately not using the word MUSL I'mS.
155,Govt must distribute Smart phone to poor and also trained them the concept and it’s operational
156,"Dr Rajan, the guy who said mudhra loans will be a disaster."
157,Very good analysis
158,"I beg to disagree. I think India is getting ready to protect her interests against the monetary monopoly of arrangements like SWIFT, etc. If and when push comes to shove, with other countries adopting our CBDC, we will be in a position to withstand pressures like the ones exerted on Russia by the West, when they boycotted Russian institutions from the SWIFT payment network at the beginning of the Ukrain-Russia war."
159,"Sir, suppose I bought 4 shares of company XYZ,  each. So, the total investment is Rs 40000. After a few months, I had a profit of Rs 10000 in my investment. Should I sell 1 share and buy a new share from a different company Will that be a good idea to do so"
160,To promote e-rupee now they have set limit on number of UPI transactions per day
161,"I fail to buy the argument that Dr. Rajan is honest or unbiased because he has played a pivotal role in developing UPI at initial stages... What a joke Intensions change... He might be influenced by the politicians in future or currently too...  And most of the economist blabber non-sense. I    'm not here a supporter of any particular party, but generally this is what happens..."
162,How come CDBC  I'mparts more control on private banks
163,CBDC can help in dealing with corruption in government. E.g Police can get ERUPE that can only be used to fule up the police car can not be spent anywhere else or govt can see where it spent.
164,I think one advantage would be that even if bank servers are down then transactions will go thru unlike today where many a times you will psu banks UPI servers are down.  Transactions will go thru because it will get recorded in central ledger and from there bank will update it’s node ledger.  It won’t take away credit giving ability of the bank as money will still be in bank account.  It will  I'mprove RB I'monitor bank customer service parameters. This has traditionally not worked in India. Banking customer service quality is very poor even in private banks except for foreign banks and may be Kotak. However CBDC will make customer flock to bank with better customer service if the banks are able to reduce banking fees because of CBDC.
165,"Perhaps one of the benefits might be that if the system goes digital, transaction costs can be el I'minated  reduced, and it could result in greater profit margins for low-margin businesses and lower goods cost to the end-customer. This is assuming the large-scale adoption of e-Rupee and decline of the cash-economy. However, such a change is likely going to affect the job market since greater automation  disruption is usually followed by greater monetary losses and employee-lay-offs. However, I still agree that the benefits are not likely going to outweigh the costs."
166,"If this is  I'mplemented successfully, it would be a great move in order to control banks."
167,"I agree with you very strongly Akshat.  There is NO NEED TO BRING CBDC.  It is a very cheap effort from government to exert more control on people.  And it has so many disadvantages.  Indian people are now almost to the point where a major lot has learned to use UPI, not even net banking or bank apps.  Majority does not know internet or apps.  So we all Indians should protest this and not use it."
168,I dont trust it bro all my privacy gone.
169,"Is this a way to circumvent the KYC norms so that dark and illegal money can be used by the governments and the powers that be. Of course, normal people can be surveilled by the powers that be"
170,"With digital currency,there will be neither receipt of interest nor transactional charges. There    's no need to keep min I'mum balance,pay fines for defaults or charges by bank for transferring money via UPI from one bank to another. Bankruptcies are never expected,like in cooperative banks seen from time time in rural sreas"
171,"In future, Govt can get a plan to make transactions by only using CBDC towards the entities where there are major risks of black money or illegal activities.  For example, currently, since there are no ways to track where the crypto currency are used, Govt can  I'mplement the deposits and withdrawals only using CBDC and this way, they can question each citizens about their usages.  S I'milarly in all those places where it is a risk illegal activities,  I'mposing the usages of CBDC only, can lower that."
172,"thank you, very informational, thank you bro"
173,"Anything Digital-only is fraught with huge risks- as we saw in Canada, the gov shut down bank accounts of truckers as they didn    't like the protests. UPI I can see the benefit of fast free transactions. CBDC is a globalist push to digital only world and social credit score and controlling and     'nudging    ' behavior. Next, they    'll say this money can only be used for gas and food. Then it becomes a mandatory amazon food voucher run by gov. Dystopian idea."
174,It    's e-Rupee sir. e-Rupi is something entirely else.
175,"The notion that anything people do that gov should know itself is a totalitarian mindset. We, the people, are sovereign, its hte gov that needs to show us, its employer, how its spending the money, not the other way around."
176,The whole idea behind decentralized currency is to prevent govt over printing and devaluing the currency and protecting your asets in that currency. Wha    'ts the point of a currency issued by a gov that is pegged to its fiat money and still be centralized Its the worst of both worlds.
177,Thanks
178,Nice content
179,Thank you for s I'mple explanation can you make a chart stating the advantages and disadvantages of erupi. One of the main disadvantages I find is no interest on the digital wallet.
180,The reason he is not promoting CBDC is because he knows what flak he got for promoting VAULD for crypto.
181,Why bond lending % was higher during Mr Rajan
182,"Why Goverment sell asset that they own, if they themself print money unlimitedly BIGGEST DOUBT ."
183,well explained Akshat
184,as per rbi  currency print costs more than 5000 crores per year excluding maintenance and transportation
185,Soon chip will come without chip you won’t be buy and sell
186,wow perfect research
187,There is no use of e-rupee. It will not successful as UPI.
188,Agree on your point Cbdc are not anyway a game changer..
189,Very informative content Akshat
190,Wowww superb explanation
191,"Where does the Government  RBI get this e-Rupi from, to start issuing to Public What is the underlying asset that is, from where RBI can give the e-Rupi Are they going to s I'mply issue e-Rupi without any actual value of Rupee Or they would convert the existing Printed notes to e-Rupi and null those value of printed notes"
192,Get an  I'mpression that this is a futile attempt by the government.  Let’s wait and watch.
193,Sir please explain what will be  I'mpact on property market by digital currency
194,"The main motive is to replace physical cash transaction in due course of time which can better result in tax collection and avoid corruption. The govt cannot openly say this, atleast for now. But it still remains to be seen as this might take a very long time."
195,The coverage is indepth and enlightening. Regarding savings for government vis a vis paper currency I think a huge amount of savings can be made in cash management costs . Not only printing but storage and transportation costs are very high. Banks and RBI has to maintain huge currency chests in so many locations. The efforts in safe transportation of currency from bank branches to their currency chests and rbi chests is huge and security costs are high. Also rbi has to pay interest on the cash of banks.
196,eRupi and CBDC are two entirely different things
197,When CBDC is same as digital money why do you think it will not earn interest Govt can also crack whips on cash hoarders and hawala traders. It also will be a game changer for international trade. Many countries want to move away from dollar-based transactions to avoid US sanctions.
198," There is a mistake here, e-RUPI is not same as e-RUPEE"
199,One s I'mple reason- public is not bearing any expenditure. The day public is forced to bear charges for using UPI user will go down exponentially.
200,"Akshat, LOVED this video."
201,"Thank you very much Akshay, for the clear cut explanation"
202,Very very nicely explained. Thanks a lot
203,Public sector bank staffs will struggle to understand and use it. First govt should train them.
204,"Right now when we say 92% of money is in some digital format, i dont think that means there is no physical cash associated with,  I actaully think, lets say we hold 1lakh in digital format say bank account, then, bank holds that physical cash in their side, so CBDC would avoid this holding of physical cash and its printing,  you havent mentioned it this way, pls evaluate my theory )"
205,Pls do a seperate vlog on Laws governing apps like INDmoney grow ect used for investment …worried after FTX collapse
206,CBDC can be good alternative to large B2B transactions which need not to go through commercials banks
207,Facts presented in this video are incorrect and misleading. Please do some more research.
208,"Who begged the contract to develop cbdc systems tcs, infosis"
209,Demonetization with CBDC would have been effective.
210,"2 benefits i see of CBDC  counterfeit notes production will get  I'mpacted if people start using CBDC due to which terrorist organizations will get  I'mpacted and also economy will benefit as counterfeit currency pumping inflates the country    's economy  tracking of the money becoems easier, so govt will know that this piece to 100 E-Rup I'moved from person A to person B and right now is in the hands of person C and if the movement made economic sense."
211,Hi Akshay. I have been following ur videos for some time now. You have been doing tremendous job so far.   When i saw ur video on cbdc i got interested to know what would you say about.  There are several details missed out in your presentation which  I'may discuss with you over a call.   Pl do let me know if you wd be interested. Thanks
212,when can we buy your courses which are sold
213,its looks like the creater want 15 minute video otherwise it can b done in 5 minute.
214,Govt. Sees cbdc as a tool to curb black money . Other than this i don    't see any rational purpose. Last time it was Notebandi (exchange your notes) this time they are silently doing it . Before we know they will  I'mplement retail e rupee as mandatory for some fractions. Accumulation of black money can seriously be challenged with this in coming future. I see precious metals being used as black money in the future . I dont know how right I am  if I am totally wrong  future will tell.
215,Pl listen to idfc chairman comments on erupi
216,"Misinterpreted content, u have to be clear"
217,"I don    't know if  I'missed out on two crucial points which are the tackling of counterfeit and the capture of black money. And in the long run the money can be vertically split into many types like carmoney foodmoney etc., In such a way that you can    't buy car with foodmoney and food with carmoney. This will allow one or two persons to eventually control interest and inflation targets by spend category. Hope lessons will be learnt in hindsight. Man eats man."
218,Rajan always find problems with every economic policy of Modi Govt. and we all know why. Any way there are always difficulties and cons on something new like CBDC
219,Is this s I'milar to the crypto BS*  %^
220,"CBDC concept is very hazy at thus stage and operational mechanism would get evolved over the pilot phase. Some of your assertions ( egFunds flow to Banking system will get curtailed and eventually may affect the economic activity) is bit premature at this stage. My belief is, eventually this mechanism may be used to control and monitor large- value commercial transactions for understandable reasons.  Nevertheless, your video provides good understanding at the concept level."
221,Very nice video sir..
222,"Goverments are misusing their power and spending money on freebies. Majority of politicians are corrupted.     Though the technology is good, it might be misused by governments.    Even common people are used to this black cash concept to avoid taxes. It is very difficult to introduce a fair accounting financial system in India.    Just my thoughts."
223,Firstly E RUPI is different from E rupee. Learn more about it before making a video.
224,"Either you did not do proper research on this or you failed to make us understand. Gives me an  I'mpression, almost you are very critical of digital rupee..You did not make any comments on digital trial,how it could be used to reduce corruption, how this could also b used to help DBT money to b used exclusively to the purpose it was given by govt,I don    't think any sensible govt would b wasting time and money if it    's of no use to economy.Many countries are in the process of adopting this technology, and taking China example  my opinion is absolutely nonsense coz any kind of tec can be misused in china.."
225,"As usual excellent and crystal clear explanation of both the pros and cons of the format, where given the mindset of the ruling party ( read as individuals) cons out weigh the pros. Let    's see what happens."
226,"this upcoming reply is to c-h-e-c-k whether any b-o-t s responding,     invest in gold or digital currencies ( BTC  ETH )    "
227,"Completely disagree with your analysis here, seems like you are afraid of people going away from your so called investment   quotcrypto  quot due to RBI digital rupee. Also you did not highlight the benefits of rupee."
228,"Everything looks good in hayday...  In india   a) Banks are being heavily regulated. Apart from some cooperative banks failing, banking is fairly stable... But this is not everywhere including usa.. and this can change very quickly.. like how Yes Bank was bankrupt... So in that case people loose money.. due to banks... That is where cbdc comes as a mechanism to have money.. rather tham stashing in gold or other asset.    b) Today UPI is free for retail because govt is paying...  I'magine tomorrow per UPI transaction cost becomes high...     So per transaction cost for UPI Is always higher than per transaction of cbdt... Because of the complexity of process ..    c) UPI is dependent on banks. Let    's say tomorrow a bank server crashes.. or a bank backs out of UPI... How will the customers of that bank use UPI ... CBCD removes that.."
229,Modi ji doesnot know nothing about money (currency) and you dont be a sanghi
230,I have a question what if this system hacked
231,How is CBDC an  I'mpact on credit lending  Finance cos like HDFC still attract deposits from customers to finance their lending business. The same model will continue - to get interest one will be able to place deposits at an interest rate by paying from CBDC. Mr Rajan loves to create issues out of nowhere and surprising you endorse h I'm.
232,Hindi
233,"If commercial banks are not gonna benefitted, why are they participating in phase mannered pilot runs.."
234,Haha..true..no much benefits
235,"Centralisation gives more power to govt., and  I'm not sure what they will do to us, may be more govt employees can choose for corruption."
236,Step 1  introduce digital rupee.  Step 2  make it easy to use for even lower class  Step 3  make digital currency a habit  Step 4  restrict physical currency withdrawal  Step 5  ban physical currency and make money digital.  Could be a great idea to make courruption literally zero if  I'mplemented correctly.
237,What if CBDC is fully  I'mplemented and physical currencies are take out of circulation Will it not curb the curruption and terrorism  Please give your insights   Thanks  for an excellent presentation
238,I think u should become consultant to RBI
239,Too judgmental… no information…
240,i fell asleep watching your explanation .....
241,"when social media came out it was hoped that it will strengthen individual liberty and for while it did, then govts and the elites used it to divide up people spreading propaganda creating echo chambers, and censoring the truth. CBDC will also be used by tyrannical govts to snatch away your economic freedom and liberty. money.  I'magine one day waking up and seeing either no money or having your money being frozen by the govt just because you decided to speak against the injustice of the govt"
242,Is Cbdc will be it in crypto on exchanges
243,Easy of doing transaction
244,Black money is not explained well
245,Akshat you explained the CDBC in such a way people will in confusion state.
246,You are anti BJP Modi
247,"If we consider CBDC to be equivalent to physical notes, then can    't the govt in near future do another demonitization of say all denomination notes above Rs 100, but this time give everyone e rupi in place of physical currency  All currency above Rs 100 can br banned. They can then solve the issue of black money in the economy. No one can keep e rupi as black money right "
248,Lets see...If it is useless...Ult I'mately govt rolls it back...So bold decisions are necessary... Some may hit some may fail...
249,We know pivotal role of Raghuraman n Chidambaram n Antonio    's nexus.
250,First e rupee... Bank to bank transactions(its useful instead of purchasing bonds etc etc)  2nd e rupee for retailers.. I think here retailers means for bussiness bigger transactions..Already they will maintain current accounts with bank.. Its plan to curb black. hidden money from market. Govt didnt say about banks..  I think its useful for companies and bussiness people not for common man  Govt already gave upto 19 dec for any suggestions..We can use it for our queries...  But financial reforms are needed whether it will be good or bad future will say .  If I am wrong can correct me...
251,the only advantage of CBDC might be     'cross border payments    ' but it will require standardized payment interface among different CBDCs of different countries.    This might make the cross-border money transfer process fast and less costly (lesser fee). But this  I'mplementation will take time as most of the countries are not ready with their CBDCs and such standardized payment interface is not even in design phase.
252,not just Raghuram Rajan mostly even you talk against the govt... Chinese economy is standing in a way better place than our even after their crisis ... it is only because India has only played safe.... CBDC can significantly reduce black money.... when you can trust in other digital currencies why not CBDC At least it is legit I'mised by an elected govt which ias very difficult to be overthrown in a massive country like ours... It might even cause anarchy.... You want me to trust some crypto regulator but not my own Govt if govt wanted they could nationalise banks as well just like they did in 1950s... We are more free today than we ever were.
253,no possibility for black money
254,Still remember what P Chidambaram said about future of UPI. It will fail.
255,Digital Rupee sounds way better than e-rupee...
256,wow
257,It is Indian government    's e-wallet money.
258,"1. Low internet penetration  2. Huge un banked economy, semi urban, rural, even cities still prefer cash  3. Digital economy is still for the lucky few  Don    't really why how it would compete  alternate with existing UPI. infra"
259,"Yeah even I had the same feeling when I first heard about CBDC. It    's practically useless, and centralization can never be good for anyone"
260,Hi..aksat..as i thik this will greatly affect..middle class and lower middle class families...it will b harder for these people to live on....as most of people have a small job or no job...  amp mainly depends on d interest on small savings..in d bank...
261,"He don    't talk about any advantage.  I think one, if transaction is done by people to people without internet, and without bank involvement like giving hard cash to another person. That is revolutionary."
262,If someone ask Comisson or brabery can I pay h I'm e rpee
264,"The problem unforeseen is that a gray market will flourish where digital currency will be converted into physical currency for a cost....thereby making mismatch equivalent to what happens to an economy if counterfeit currency is half of total currency....then policy decisions based on logistics becomes off the mark....  another fatal outcome would be that cbdc can be programmed to suit a community, section of society, caste, or even religion, no one else can use the token except the intended party...."
265,"In my opinion e-rupi will be used for giving loans. Bank will issue loan only in e-rupi, this will decrease the willfull defaulter NPA."
266,"too much speculation and extrapolation of chines    ' cameras analogy, also making CDBC vs UPI and Jam, not very coherent narrative against rupee advantages"
267,Well explained sir . U made it so s I'mple
268,It seems you are a great fan and admirer of Raghuram Rajan. So no point in telling you the advantages of DC. As the people like you have already made up negative mindset. Best thing is to unsubscribe you which I    'm going to do after posting this comment.
269,"I did not get this point, how this is going to harm the general public "
270,I don    't think how He got information from China Gov Intrest  Their own citizens don    't get the gov Data But Indians get it    I an sure CBDC is one of best syetem ever in Financs system . People using Android can get into CBDC very very soon and earn its benifit as service charges are non available  and physical cash will pinch service charges from pocket    This Report is half knowledge about CBDC ..
271,"Hi  Awesome finance learning from your channel. I have little money saved and hail from a lower middle class family. I want to make smart investments other than traditional FDs (where actually I    'm in loss as FD rates not even match inflation). How to select where else... and how could I invest smartly with lesser risk as I    've very little margin I can play with. If I want to select mutual funds then how should I find which MF is best for me and how to invest Whether I should go with gold bonds or buying physical gold, which option should I go for and how If I want to go with Debt bonds then need a way. Kindly guide me if possible as per how should I go ahead and not get confused. Will always be indebted for the knowledge you share. Thanks a lot...."
272,do you make interest on cash in wallet E-Rupi is same except in digital form where you no longer need to carry wads of notes in pocket...nothing less nothing more.
274,"Absolutely wrong interpretation of digital Rupi by Akshat. You are s I'mply misguiding people against an excellent format of currency, Akshat. This digital currency will largely min I'mize the leakage of DBT money. Lot other benefits are also there."
275,"The biggest problem in India is tracking government money allocated to needed people that will be solved, don    't expect one  I'mplementation can solve everything in india"
276,The major reason is central government is subsidizing upi transaction due to multiple merchants involved as amount of upi transactions are increasing leaps and bounds it will cost lot more. There might be possiblity that in future upi transactions are charged as well like  I'mps so CBDC could be an alternative to that plus adoption of blockchain technology which is transparent and much safe as well could be promoted.
277,Great Analysis....
278,great video as usual
279,UPI was not developed and institutionalised by raghuram rajan...    It was Nandan nilenkani team that developed india stack...
280,"I see this being used to provide Govt subsidies directly to people and reduce misuse of these money. Example, I have seen farmers take agri loans and buy cars and other luxury items. If the smart contracts are brought into action, govt  banks will put the erupi into bank account and the farmer can only use it for fertilizers, seeds  plantations, rentals for agri based vehicles and services and so on. This way we are plugging the leaks in a more polite manner. If govt takes action, then majority of the people will start protesting - hence this step. I could be wrong, but its only another way of understanding."
281,no words i am just 200% agreed
282,"S I'mply awesome  sir, the topic is indeed complex but you made it too lucid for any amateur... thanks "
283,It    's not bank fd and sb for earning interest
284,e-rupi is purpose specific there is no cash involvement anywhere whereas in DBT beneficiary gets direct money which gives discretionary power to use this money for any purpose even purchasing gutka too... a  c to me e-rupi is just one step ahead in initiating welfare to the people efficiently.
285,"The best use for cbdc with a centralized ledger is to make sure we have a transparent system between loans being given to states from the center and it    's utilization by states and vice versa for revenues being collected from states as part of cgst and sgst. If cbdc centralized ledger can utilise this through blockchain  it gives the citizens a lot of insight . But in relation to the video, the options where this is being utilized make no sense "
286,CBDC is a Digital prison for the whole world. The sooner people recognise this the better it is. CBDC is the best tool for any dictatorial authoritarian rule. CBDC can be used to shut any individual or a group permanently just by switching them off digitally. Any one having different political opinion other than the government in control can be isolated permanently from the illusory digital financial services. You s I'mply don    't exist. Dangerous trend.
287,Vo you know something As a complete layman I wondered ( and wonder now) what benfit to the concumer or the government the e-rupi( CBDC) would bring. I am relieved that you think that there would be no benefit at all. So I    'm going to eatch this space.
288,Awesome
289,Thanks a lot
290,"Wonderfully explained  Thank you for clarifying, i was also confused."
291,"are you a puppet of  I'mF, WORLD BANK   amp INDIAN GOVT. which explain this matter not with a cons only with pros why"
292,In short CBDC is a merchant account with the RBI instead of having an account with commercial bank. And this might be backed by a block chain infrastructure.
293,A great explanation akshat ur eloquancy and knowledge are truly outstanding
294,"It felt strange that you went so soft on e-Rupi. Government can invalidate your e-Rupi after certain period of time if you do not spend the money in order to keep economy in good shape. Government can prevent you from spending your own money on some of the things if they want to. With e-Rupi government can directly debit the money from your account with out your permission if you participate in dharnas, protests etc. Basically Government can enforce everything it wants, crushing individual freedom, choice. We all know what happens to such societies."
295,jam yojana will be introduced because currently government is giving money to farmers and poor people. but government cant control how people will spend this money. so they will create voucher. which will people avail only on specific shops. for example if you are giving 5000₹ worth of voucher to farmer he can avail in fertiliser shops or equipment shops only. that way money will not be wasted for other purposes.
296,Sir it may not succeed because politicians Nd businesses man cannot hide black money . This is my thought.
297,"Its e-rupee n not e-rupi,  Misleading content"
298,see think school video
299,I totally did not get the point where the China    's people surveillance system is compared with the CBDT
300,"Main purpose of CBDC is to create an Internationally tradable currency without using any of the current payment networks like Swift, which are controlled by West. In an eventual case of sanctions as in case of Russia where Swift payments were blocked disrupting trade this would help.     So in case CBDC is successful we would have a mechanism in place to trade globally without much disruption.    Second reason is INR is highly dependent on USD and hence is volatile. If trade happens in INR,  I'mporters   amp exporters need not worry of Currency risk. Making INR more stable, creating lot value for business in the long run."
301,"The Govt. officials like corporators and MLAs are doing some scams in a different way that they are wasting lots of money to build unnecessary gates, banners and statues, etc. and also doing district, taluka, railway station etc re-naming process..  This money is our Taxes so way they are doing it and wasting so much money.  Whether its really needed to do this.     Even when they took their meetings they are just enjoying their lunch, dinner, etc. This also our Tax money .. why  We giving the power to them all this shit "
302,This is being done to end the role of comml banks because now there will be no need to open bank accounts . And gen public is going to be hit hard because than only few 2  3 banks will remain and wont give even 6 % int like present. Public will have to invest in capital fds  thereby benefitting cspitalists .
303,"Saraa english ek side pe, aur dusre side pe  Real india kisiko abhi samajh mai nahi aaya hai.  In the coming cash usage aggravate the economic growth.   The gvts think  citizens are fools."
304,you should host a debate with two sides - pros and cons - of CDBC. Will be interesting to see you and Think School    's Ganesh Prasad
305,This system of govt control can and sure one day bring india into bankruptcy. Very dangerous trend and system of governence.
306,Soon other banks will close because they will have no work hence banks will close and RBI will take complete control.. Then there will be no physical currency in circulation rupee will die and only digital rupee of RBI will function. This will be another disaster like demonetzation of indian rupee complete. God save india from disaster. Very bad future.poor man will be at hardship to survive.
307,looks like you are reacting too early like small children and popcorn youtubers. reference to rajan and uguhrs shows your where you are heading. please restrain from one sided views .
308,i think there are fallacy in your argument. RBI is not getting into credit. it has been issuing notes in physical form  not is issuing in digital currency  the currency in circulation even today is decided by RBI  Finance ministry  there is not transparent formula that is being used or public by neither rbi nor finance ministry. in fact RBI has started SGL-for bonds and now citizen open the account directly. this is to save the cost for the GOI as they had to pay money to the intermediaries being bank.
309,"Will RBI Do the mining to issue Digital rupee like z,Bitcoin etc "
310,"Very nicely explained. Yes, private banks will be starved of money for loan purpose. Maybe govt wants to monitor pvt banks that extend loans."
311,I am against digital money because I respect Ghandhi ji plz don    't change money modi is against great freedom fighter so he decided
312,Father of nation ko sab bol Jaye gai
313,Digital money sai
314,Hello sir I am a beginner and want to start my SIP in MF with 10k per month for 15 to 20 yeras. Can you suggest how many MF    's should be there in my portfolio and what are they please
315,Clearly left leaning commentator. however if politics in video are kept aside information is there to be absorbed. will suggest akshat not to show bias during content creation
316,Nice information thank you so much sir explain very easy and s I'mple language English I understand.  My English is very week but I understanding
317,Jo chacha hai wo hi Bhatia hai aur jo Bhatia hai wo hi chacha hai
318,Is it not due to crypto currencies popularity that government is also launching its own official crypto currency what about tamper proof and auditing capabilities Aren    't they advantages of digital currency
319,great job bro for making such we’ll explained video
320,One of the main advantages of this new distributed ledger is it will not leave any scope for physical intentional tampering of the subledgers held by the banks which eventually leads to an incomplete main ledger visible to the RBI.
321,the centralised control of everything is always has it    's threats. this move can even make easy to stash black money and transactions. cool
322,"Pl go slow to understand it would be easier,"
323,E-Rupi Ability to give Loans directly to corp-orates by RBI ( practically Government) is little bit dangerous as Capitalists are controlling most of the government policies by funding elections which in turn is returned by cheap loans to them .  Disaster is waiting ahead if this Adani  Ambani fails . I suspect they have huge NPA hidden below carpet as Banks do not have privacy issues in disclosing small retail loan defaults but Big defaults  NPA they   quotSee  quot privacy issues  even Supreme court agrees
324,"This video is basically ill-informed on almost every aspect-  The money one holds in bank A  C or in wallets is digital money for the user, not for RBI. RBI had to print notes in physical form somewhere at any point in time. e-rupi will be completely digital ie- produced and transferred.    RBI tends to gain control over anything which involves money, they are bestowed power and responsibility to control the inflation by a statute.     your views are highly political and misinformed. Even though you did not call any names, one can observe you    're giving a negative connotation to this initiative merely because you don    't like the government.    This video needs to be reported on a mass"

327,BTC zindabad
328,There is physical note deposited by you against balance in your bank account    Whereas not in case of cbdc.
329,Show the government wants to secure his centralisation power by enabling CBDC and AFRAID OF DECENTRALIZATION....
330,It is great to hear the truth from you Akshat that even RBI doesn’t exactly know how this CBDC is different from the other digital money that already exists .
331,Basically we are heading towards one party rule system
332,"Raghu chor Rajan American se,x slave hai  anti India Raghu chor Rajan"
333,Just like CBDC even Akshat    's hair stylist doesn    't give any real advantage
334,"It would be better if   1.They introduced the e-rupi as a higher form of currency(token) like 1 e-rupee valued at 10000rs .So that in a way it would facilitate the small transaction into a larger sum.    a   2.as    2.As    a   a current account only currency,it can give you   a   intrest.so    intrest.so    a   that more n more marchants shall use those e-rupee.    a   3.it    3.it    a   should be named properly...e rupi does sound functional."
335,"these are some of the advantages that I can think of -seigniorage, coupon-like direct benefit transfers, tracking of money. but any rational freethinker can understand that the cost outweighs the benefit. This all-pervasive technocratic centralised control-freak of a government will only cause more trouble."
336,Very good analysis
337,Well presented. Balanced   amp made easy.
338,Devastating for most  middle class families as  there will be no interest  income on which many  families are surviving.
339,Unable nahi sir enable
340,Govt is trying to have more control on common people through CBDC.   The fun part is that Blockchain technology was invented for Freedom.
341,Thanks for providing balanced views on cbdc akshat.
342,"Because of the digital rupee, the volume of paper currency will come down and illegal transactions happening in cash will come down."
343,Mooodi G ...Govt is planing CHINA like Authoritarian Reg I'me..Then it make sense why MOOODi G wants CBDC.....he is following the footsets of CHINA......INDIA will also be a Survilance STATE.....
344,What an amazing explanation sir
345,Thanks akshat. Feels good to know the details.
346,CBDC will eradicate corruption.  Whatever road contract government giving all payments to be done in digital rupee. All the raw materials bought for the road contract should be in digital rupee.
347,"I don    't think this is gonna benefit a common man in our country. This system might ease the complexity with foreign exchange where if you can cut the middle man you can save the commission these intermediary entities charge, which again helps millionaires and billionaires attracting foreign investments. The government can    't say this out loud that they are investing crores for a system that    's gonna aid the elites, as it would cause chaos among the voting population that the government is again aiding the rich and ignoring the poor, hence the gov came up with some lame excuses of direct transfer of benefits to poor beneficiaries."
348,"CBDC mainly helps for horse trading of purchasing MLA and MP by BJP without distrubing public money. no need to worry of bank accounts, containers and suitcases."
349,"Fear-mongering, anti establishment agenda  fears. CBDT is bad because Chinese are misusing it Bitcoin is good for some  I'maginary reason. You have no real argument against it."
350,maybe it    's time to get a good camera
351,RBI is testing this CBDC model with bank. If bank is not involved in this CBDC. How the banks is allowing to test it
352,There is a difference in e-Rupee and e-RUPI.. you need to correct your Title
353,Excellent content and great s I'mplification Akshat on digital rupee.
354,b  CONTROL COMMUNAL ACCOUNTS    b
355,"You dont understand the topic itself, when you said that there is no real benefit of CBDC ..    By introducing CBDC     The digital cash systems ll be more secure and the ledger ll be distributed and there ll be no single point of failure.    As there is single source of truth then settlement ll be instantly and there ll be a huge cost saving in settlement.    3rd User ll have their own choice to keep custody of their own money in real sense by keeping thier money on non custodial wallet .. that mean giving more power to people    4th CBDC is programable like NFTs so Govt can introduce various program and money that is intent to spend on those projects ll only be spent on those project and there is 0 possibility of leakages.     5 - all exisitng system ll be enabled to work ll UPI qnd they ll not be abandoned like you had mentioned..    Last but the most  I'mp .. influencer should not make video if they themselves have no knowledge on the topic"
356,"From the end user perspective, CBDC dosent provide any advantage over UPI.   It can be useful in countries which doesn    't have something like UPI, but don    't see it getting adoption in India."
357,Does India have any advantage of creating CBDC to establish INR as reserve currency in BRICS trade Is that possible
358,"Digital rupee has greater control and transperant than current digital money, life of each note can be traced and conyrolled, current digital money you know movement ofceach account not each note ie the big difference, through smart money you can force some notes valid for only some transaction (purchases) only not valid for other purchases etc so gov can channelise didital notes to specific transactions only."
360,"you speaks very fast, should be little slow like 0.75x so that every new person digest the content."
361,To face sanctions
362,Tha Goverment should concentrate on monitoring how politicians hoard cash and take a cut on all Govt spendings. How many politicians will work for only salary. There is corrupt earning that is why politicians want to contest elections and come to power as they see good earning potential. This Govt is only after common peoples hard earned money.
363,Receiving Remittances can be much more efficient via CBDC
364,If it prevents money laundering by banks to the defaulters like Nirav modi and Vijay mallya bcoz of them banks shuts and common mans money stuck into banks like PMc for years then what is the problem with CBD... Centralisation is always better...
365,One of the advantages is that there are no middle man needed ( eg swift ). Peer to peer payment can be done and done in real-time. That is why cost would be less. Now if cost could be lowered then good better exchange rates could be given for such transaction. It would also be ready to use it for currency swaps in future between countries. US is already worried about there currency for the Chinese and moving to digital dollars. India wants to think in those lines.Advantage within india would be it would be highly efficient banking system especially recon. Going forwards a bank like HDFC could launch its own equalant of Visa credit cards.   Soon the govt. could create a use case for digital land transactions once the tech. Is in place linking backing and real estate not only for payments but for non tampered documents on blockchain too.
366,"Thanks bud for keepin us financially Educated Regardless of how bad it gets on the economy, I still make over $13,000 every single week"
367,Really good explanation of a very complicated topic... I    'm really glad that i am subscribed to you.
368,Finally govt. May decide everything what you can do with digital rupi and people may just be like slaves... already I doubt about the freedom of speech.
369,no advantage over UPI only central govt having direct control over public pockets. and easy loans for adanis
370,Thanks Akshat Good job of explaining complex things in s I'mple words
371,Just seeing spams and bots gdp increases as refferal code and see the likes on that comment all are more than the rest comments without refferal code so much of bots
372,Hi Akshat  can you talk about the   quotSecurities Lending Income Program   quot in Vested in your upcoming video
373,Mobile battery khatam ho jane se Kay karu
374,good MEANS
375,Sir please make a video on dhirubhai ambani.
376,This government wants to make IND a china. Crazy intentions to flush money out of its nationals pocket.
377,Basically billions of public money wasted again due to  I'mporper governance
378,inshort - No benefit
379,Rajan is a Marxist goon
380,No intrest is obnoxious
381,"Can a poor people or common people who do not have mobile phones use this   quot E-rupi   quot and how, please explain it to all 140 crore peoples of India so that each and every person can easily understand it  understand them in their language. Don    't make such video that already have been uploaded by others youtubers. Namaskar."
382,"I wonder, even now people are getting  I'mpressed by comments of Mr. Raghuraman Rajan"
383,But which type of blockchain it is POS POW or ...
384,You aask too many questions before start of YouTube
385,when is the next batch coming on stock market
386,"Through direct transfer central government directly buy votes, so subsidies will come directly from central government normal times state government divert money to free bies and corruption offers to politicians."
387,Superb content
388,"I don    't agree with your argument that only 8% of INR is in cash   amp rest are in digital format currently. Fact is for every so called digital currency (i.e. paytm or bank account) there is a back up of physical currency either with the commercial bank or with the central bank (RBI). So these UPI, NEFT,  I'mPS, RTGS, Cheques are all based on physical currency   amp commercial banks clear their records for transfers within themselves at the end of the day with the help of RBI. Point is RBI have to print   amp reprint these paper notes   amp coins with huge expenses. With CBDC this this huge cost will evaporates. Add on benefit is you can not store it as black money. So your basic argument is not correct."
389,instead of such useless thing govt can increase upi limit and no of transaction above ten    charge 1 or 2 rupess after limit
390,Very informative and biased video  Put yourself in place of government to el I'minate the bias.
391,"This is the 1st video of urs I ever saw and I have already subscribed to u.  I have seen a few videos regarding e-rupi  but no one was telling the main thing, HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM   quotUPI  quot, and why would people wanna shift to it. Thanks a lot for such a great in-depth video."
392,One key point This e-Rupee will also be a programmable rupee which can only be used where it is intended to be. So its all about control.
393,Physical rupee notes will be done away with soon. Big savings in cost  paper  transportation  physical storage  etc and benefits environment too. Not sure why you can    't see the benefits.
394,e-Rupi and e-rupee is different. CBDC you’re talking about is e-rupee but you’re thumbnail shows e-Rupi which is wrong
395,True Banking system may affect. but in future conventional lending process might change. If conventional lending process changes economy will be more stable in terms of NPAs. To invest People might buy bonds or some kind of financial product to lend to companies.
396,One  I'mpratant point is that it can theoretically enable digital money transfer in offline mode.
397,"E-Rupee is what I think s I'milar to digital Yaun the Chinese is planning to unleash.....    People might think it    's technological advancements...but it    's instrument of Authoritarian control, yes    That    's how China designed it    's whole financial system around Digital Yuan....    Indian Government the trying to convert India into theocratic Autocracy, to excercise more tighter control trying to bring something s I'milar I believe"
398,b  as the war comes all market cap of companies will get erased due to all their units destroyed. Survive that first. I will never pay such market valuations. Inflation is on hyper hyper levels. This nonsense is the least of anyones problems    b
399,Cdcs are mainly used for cross border payments between institutions and countries  the scope for the general public will come later ...
400,"As an RBI Employee i can tell you all know about the advantages of digital rupee once you visit the issue section of RBI.  You don    't have any idea how much labour cost, technology cost and time it takes to complete one life cycle of a single note.    Regarding your concern about centralised control, any scheme in nascent condition needs to be controlled by people who are experts in that field  my belief once the digital rupee infrastructure gets well developed control will be decentralised."
401,I agree this is misadventure which this govt. wants to do with no advantage to public. Nobody needs this currency which govt wants to push down the throat of Indian public.
402,very good content. good research
403,Nobody is telling the viewers that CBDC eRupee is indeed Demonetization 2.0
404,"Hey Akshat, is there any possibility of risk of getting hacked"
405,What will be the effect of CBDC on real estate prices in the long term.
406,Nothing is self executable everything is controlled and monitored by central planners
407,Follow process what USA and Japan are following.. rather than Chinese government process.. useless E rupee
408,E-rupi is not CBDC retail. E-Rupee is CBDC retail. Please Correct ur heading. E-rupi is like voucher.
409,Cbdc is dangerous you speak anything against government they will seize your e rupee and will just give you a notice
410,You forgot to mention some points  1. Cbdc will be a substitute to swift network and others. Like in 2016 usa banned iran from selling oil... india could not use any payment channel to trade..so it has to abide to usa terms.    2. It will benifit atmarnirbhar bharat by linking with upi as it is free and there is no fee on any transactions unlike in usa and other capitalistic countries.    3. In near future we may even see atm getting obsolete as maintaining physical cash is a burden to government..so all my get digital.    4. As the e-rupi is backed by rbi as legal tender.. so in any fraud cause.. when someone swipe away ur funds..there is less chance u vll get it back...as today banks dont take responsibilities for any cybercr I'me... this will make rbi liable to give compensation to citizens.    Overall its a smart move by rbi to bring such remarkable instruement .
411,Benefits of CBDC is control of corruption   This single benefit will change fate of India
412,One benefit will be the reduction in corruption in different central and state government project execution. The money can be tracked if it is being used for the purpose it has been assigned for. Please watchout p gurus channel for more info.
413,Lé People  Manga Kisne Tha CBDC...  Lé Govt.  Bus aise hi sexy lag raha tha...
414,very useful video...
415,It is being promoted for central funded scheme in states so that centre can track the money and corruption is min I'mised.
416,Here is the honest opinion i am watching akshat video since when he has 7 lakh followers in his previous videos he used to say facts and let us decide our good and bad but now i am seeing he is forcing his opinions and presenting this is god for economy this is bad for economy as per his limited knowledge either he cla I'ming he knows much better than all experts on economy or rbi executive or banks senior executive or he is just a fool trying to become wannabe intellectual you tell me how many of you have benefited from his financial adviice of spending money either in blockchain based crytocurrencies or in any shares he suggested i would love to know.
417,Enable is pronounced as     'In-able    ' not     'un-able    '. Sounds weird to hear it as unable )
418,"There is no interest, no return on Investment how can it be a alternative to cryptocurrency"
419,"Isn    't it our money right now is digital and physical moneywhy do we need digital currency when we are using digital money thru UPI,"
420,"If everyone is using UPI and if we pay directly from our account to other account isn    't that call digital money,do we need another digital moneyi think what we are doing is just fine,we can pay using UPI and when we want cash we can withdraw from ATM and i think is is just perfect."
421,1.Easy money transfer between countries in bilateral trades  2.BRICS is working on a currency to counter USD domination in market and it is said that this currency will be a digital currency backed by gold or even commodities because recently Saudi wants to join the BRICS  3. So according to me the use of this type of currency is more on the international trade rather than domestic

426,"Hello Akshat, need some help and advice. I had sent money from my bank account to Vested direct account. I then changed my mind and want to withdraw money out of it. But unable to do it. Can u help please"
427,Very sad that govt is taking complete control of public money. Yes the top govt officials and politicians will have control of your and my money and has every chance of duping the public at large. This is like china that our govt too wants to control our money and miss use them for their benefit.

429,Your efforts are welcome.
430,"Taking Piyush Goyal and Raghuram Rajan statement is so lame. Also the video does not do justice to the point that it can help targetted DBT, e.g. money given for fertilizer can be used for intended purpose.     Another lame and funny argument was, why you created JAM, when you had to create e-rupi. Bro - there    's is a word called evolution and concurrent existence of two systems is alright. NEFT, UPI,RTGS all exist today.   There are multiple other stupid argument as well,"
431,"it is centerlized control, I dont see any benifit of it."
432,"Good Video. But it is premature to conclude that it doesn    't have major advantage. Just  I'magine a use case On successful testing of CBDC, if Govt comes with a decision of all major transactions more than 10L(just an example), must be via CBDC, this may remove black money (For Ex. Real estate, Gold purchase etc.,).Lets wait and watch"
433,"Government will have all the knowledge of flow of money  this will help them to collect more tax from middle class family, earlier it was easier to save by family,   Every thing is changing buy why not Govt is increasing its basic exemption limit from last more than 5 year basic exemption is fixed 2.5  3  5 lakh    Why 80c deduction is only Till 1.5 lakh from last many year    There are very different Questions which Government must think ."
434,"Then its like bitcoin  Then money with credit or debit done it by cbdc that be at public banks,but not with RBI.RBI controls it  is like wallet"
435,Erupi is also instrument to send money but it is different than upi as in upi you send money directly from bank 2 bank by same person .  In erupi one person can create voucher and give to some one else so they can use that voucher wherever it is decided by person who created it .  It is exactly like amazon shopping voucher where someone can create voucher by paying amazon some money and give it to anyone to shop on Amazon only.  In case of erupi usage is not limited to shopping but it can be used many places .Currently not much details is available but as per my knowledge this will be game changer as it will reduce misuse of money both in government and corporate.  Government now can create erupi and give it to farmer to buy only seeds in the form of seed subsidy instead of giving money to farmer account( DBT) where it is not gurantee whether farmer will buy seed or something else.  Corporate now can issue erupi voucher to there employee for there outstation visits for hotel access and travel expense instead of forcing employee to submit proof of expense  Health insurance company can s I'mply go away with cashless card instead they can issue erupi to there customer which can only be used in designated hospital which will save there Hugh money.  It    's usage can be many in future we will just see this to happen.  Once the adoption rate goes up  cash economy will vanish over long term.   Why do you not see these benefits from cbdc Rgs.

438,Does RBI have the reserves of these e-rupees with them or is this created out of thin air
439,"It increases the accountability of the money. Every currency spent can be traced. The cases like bribe, dowry, kidnapping will be significantly reduced. the tax system can be more inclusive as hoarding of cash by many will now be abolished."

441,"I have a feeling. Hear me out. Currently direct to bank transfers are in terms of money. So basically that money can be used for anything. Like jan dhan etc. I think CBDC will or could eventually launch a system where the money (e-rupi) can be transferred for a particular cause. For example, if PM launches a education yojna so that money can ONLY and only be used for fees. Or buying cycles or buying laptops or electricity bill. The smart contract will only work on certain condition. Might sound a little too much but could be this"

444,"I am a Software Engineer in AmazonPay. I have a decent knowledge of the UPI system, and even I am unable to understand the advantages of CDBC.   One thing i would like to point out Akshat is that while power in the hands of government in India is a bad thing, in this case power wont be in the hands of the government. It will be distributed, and ledger information(hopefully) will be available publically with only public keys and wallet ids(s I'milar to how ethereum networks are built today). This way, when a large transaction occurs it can  I'mmediately be brought into notice and government can be questioned or they can come into action if they suspect fraud or corruption. This can be a better approach to payment, but it has its flaws too.   One of the flaws which you missed is the flaw of Blockchain technology itself. Since its distributed in nature it has to maintain a lot of redundant data sets and since we are talking about scales as large as UPI network, it will be very inefficient to maintain so many ledgers. RBI currently only maintains the net inflow and outflow of cash through transactions from each bank, that too every 6 hours. Everything else is maintained by the Banks themselves. It will be interesting to see what more this tech has to offer..."
445,I don    't quite agree with your point here. CBDC is necessarily a digital version of physical currency. So everything that a bank does now .. can done with the e₹ too. I think your assumption of banks as mere keepers  distributors of physical currency isn    't accurate.
446,"What you are not talking about how different banks can be settle their transfers efficiently using CBDC  what takes 2 to 3 days happens within a few hours with CBDC - that is not being pointed out. That being said it does not really give an advantage to the retail users. However, this is a great tool for the settlement systems across the banks."
447,The main reason for introducing CBDC is that all the BRICS nations are introducing a currency of their own which is gold backed and it’s supposed to compete with USD   CBDC can easily exchanged with this new currency easily as it is more centralised   In the short term u r right but when u think of the future CBDC is definitely helpful  International trade will become a hell lot easier
448,"After CBDC, Central Government will save the per transaction cost which is paid by the Finance Ministry to the respective bank for performing transaction(for the service provided).    As CBDC allows RBI to give the service to the customer directly Finance Ministry  Central Government will manage to save heavy amount."
449,"Nice video. But, are you sure RBI using Blockchain technology to introduce e-Rupee or something else"
450,CBDC real value comes in with Invoice payments.. we can discuss it if you have time..
451,"That    's a very socialist approach from govt.  Why is govt doing that, i heard that the BRICS nation are also trying to come up with a digital currency among themselves which will be backed by gold. Is moving away form fiat currencies a wise decision for emerging economies This might seriously hurt the creation of credit"
452,E-RUPI and e-Rupee are different as I understand. One is voucher system another is CBDC.
453,It is not clear as to how the problem of double spending will be resolved when money gets transferred from one wallet to another with out underlying blockchain.
454,"There is a mistake in your explanation,  Even if the money is in your bank account bank has to keep physical cash in lieu with that money in your account.  Also any new money that comes into the system RBI has to print cash and give it to banks,   Incase of e₹ RBI will give banks money not in cash but in digital form .  So currently any money in the system (whether in bank account) will have to have a physical note somewhere but this will not be the case with launch of e₹"
455,"Had my doubts, wanted to see govt. argument....turns out govt. is running behind FOMO. CBDC in China is going to be used to essentially subdue the population financially and keep them in check. If seen getting out of line cbdc in China will essentially make you unable to spend money bcoz your identity will be linked. S I'mply put its not only CBDC but a version of programmable currency and to see what havoc that plays in the economy just wait and see after these Covid lockdown protests in China."
456,"Excellent videos, you always make tough concepts easy )"
457,hi Akshat    Thanks for such an informative video on CBDC. Really appreciate this video because right from the announcement of CBDC I really didn    't understood what real advantage does it provide to a common man. finally there    's a video  information point on internet that explains it in relatively s I'mple terms.    Thanks Again )
458,Hiii akshat I would like to know more clearly thou u did manage to cover up almost all bullet points however if there are more disadvantages then positive changes of cbs then wts the whole point of govt wanting to introduce to mass by wasting huge masses money itself (as ur said there are more negative pls then being positive of  I'mplementing such a whole new money system be it in physical or digital format pls explain in detail in new video with regards to my query thks-keep up the gud work   amp I appreciate ur precious time   amp efforts to explain such intruige topics in very less time
459,"Blind rush to technology will lead to disaster.  First,all the adhaar cards of dead be deactivated. A life certificate every six months is necessary. Any account without living certificate should be blocked.There are chances of benami and dummy accounts hiding black money.  Some food for the government before doing gaga under technology.  Best known fact is no bank spends on security,also the government.Block chain will make it difficult to trace the identity.  Its easy for RBI to declare policy to save the banks and execute the customer for the system fault.All like MALLAYA AND MODI WILL BE AWAY FROM THE COUNTRY."
460,"thank you so much, it was really helpful."
461,"Short summary  1. CBDC is an electronic version of rupee  2. CBDC is deployed on a blockchain and have a centralized ledger  3. No functional difference between making a payment by CBDC and UPI  4. CBDC seems to act in a way to empower governments more and take away power from banks  5. CBDC has no interest component. Better to keep money in bank to earn interest  6. CBDC is not designed properly and even the government is not able to properly lay out it    's benefits    I guess government just wants more power over the money of the common man. They want lesser amounts of money to be left untracked via physical format, so that they leave no stone unturned for taxation. On the other hand, maintaining a centralized ledger would help people in power to e̶x̶p̶l̶o̶i̶t̶ fight corruption more  See Win win situation for the nation "
462,"A benefit is that maintaining UPI is costly and govt has to pay the banks for transactions, CBDC will be a direct transfer so the maintaining cost will be very low"
463,"I strongly agree on the disadvantages of CBDC you mentioned din video. As earlier there wee phone banking came into existence and mostly politicians and higher bank authorities misused it, I think none form the public were actually avialing it. Seems this is just a exper I'ment to min I'mize the hard cash uses in market and min I'mize the corruption."
464,Till now  the govt has taken many useless decisions like demonetization   amp now cbdc is good to be one of them
465,One of the reasons why I think the government n RBI is pushing it is to remove the intermediaries n for the transfer of money for direct benefit transfers n also to give various subsidies as its a pre programmable money. So yeah I hope it brings the efficiency that the system needs.
466,"Comparing Chinese Musl I'ms problem with CBDC was really stupid   When we have technology where no middleman (banks) are required, why to give chance of any manipulation.   Corruption is eating the whole country from years and with small reasons now people shall be given chance to do anything they want.  Anyways RBI already collects data from the banks with information system which is mandatory for banks to provide."
467,"If it allows government to crush certain communities, all the more reason to  I'mplement it."
468,"Super akshat... Nice, crisp n to point video.. Very Informative and easy to understand... Take a like"
469,The interest thing can be changed by listing the erupi in stock markets and bonds and etfs but you are right it will reduce earning potential of the banks
470,"I don    't know but when the whole world is trying to adopt and create their own digital currency  it is further refined and develops the block chain technology which is further used for multiple applications...i    'm not certain but RBI is always face problems to tackle inflation when RBI do operation regarding inflation curbing the commercial banks ignore or bent the guidelines, so might be possible that Rbi is concentrating more power ."

473,Very bold and honest opinion brother...this requires courage..thank u for insights...God bless you
474,"Hi Akshat, my knowledge of CBDC is all from this video, but here    's the benefit I see    Since this system skips the layer of private banks during transactions, this will bring enormous transparency and accountability on transactions.    Think about the following  - Tax transparency  - Debt    Loan transparency  - International transactions accountability (funding of terror and    or black money)    Also, since CBDC is a blockchain network (centralised, but anyway) it can also make eRupi an alternative for blockchain applications    businesses to use instead of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Although, Polygon or other blockchains might be a better choice at the moment, but it    's the first initiative by Govt in the blockchain space and with time it might actually evolve into a viable option.    It mostly benefits the government, but I don    't consider the   quotjanta  quot to be separate from the government. I don    't think this a zero sum game between government and the masses.    Again I am not sure about how it works and if these benefits will ever occur, but this is what I can see right now"
475,The main advantage of CBDC is to facilitate transaction when there is no internet. This could help in rural areas where there is no internet connectivity to avail direct benefits transfer
476,"Hi Akshat There    's one thing I would like to know. Are these CBDCs uniquely traceable If so, then a unit specific ownership history could be made. This could allow us to identify illicit transactions. Thus discouraging and reducing such transactions."
477,HI Akshat - I don’t think RBI CBDC is directly managed and issued by RBI. This is done through intermediary banks. You can read the RBI circular on 29 Nov.   Agree that there are no major advantages seen from a retail perspective. Thanks for s I'mplifying the concept of CBDC
478,Cbdc is like a single ledger framework. It’s supposed to provide real-time transaction in books and enabling smooth syncing of commercial bank and rbi ledgers. There’s is small chance that it can help countries to by pass the swift system if the frameworks are s I'milar for two countries.
479,One benefit of CBDC could be to tag the currency with government welfare schemes and let that tagged currency be used only for the earmarked scheme. This way govt can prevent abuse of money allocated through such schemes.    For ex Rs100 that is given by govt to a poor citizen to buy ration from PDS shop will be used only for that purpose and the citizen can be restricted to not use that currency for any other purpose.
480,"Nowadays, many medium sized shops are not accepting visa or MasterCard and accept only UPI     Who would    've thought "
481,"I am quite  I'mpressed to see people talk about the best market trader, I have been a client of his for over a year and I can attest to his professionalism. Most of my trades are successful with his assistance. He is an apt and transparent trader."
482,I think the main advantage could be like paying from e-wallet to e-wallet without involving any banks.
483,"Pardon me if I am being naive. In my view the banks will continue to do their business - they will continue to credit people    's salaries, they will continue to lend, borrow and so on. Not clear why this feeling of threat from RBI. May be I am overs I'mplifying- at least for starters, CBDC is a good idea to replace paper currency  not entirely though. I doubt RBI would want to replace the banking system as a whole That    's infeasible even if they wished. It    's much better bossing the banks around than doing their job"
484,this is the only video which covers disadvantages too
485,"I    'm done sitting tight for the award advance since i acquire$23,000 every 12 days of my investment."
486,"Despite the economic downturn, I    'm happy ☺️. I have been earning $60,200 returns from my $10,000 investment every 13 days"
487,When Upi was introduced people also questioned it but everyone knows how upi helped us grow in a better way
488,I think CBDC can help in international payments and might help vastro account process.   Some usages of it can’t be directly stated by govt officials but it can help strengthening the rupee in long run
489,"Hi Akshat, one thing I can think of is international trade. As of now, it is extremely complicated with nostro Vostro accounts and multiple banks. Instead, if we use CBDC of let us say US and India to do trade, we can cut out a lot of these middlemen. The central bank of each country is known to the central bank of every other country and hence the transactions have authority. Plus it will be faster, cheaper and more secure. We can also have DCs for different trading groups, like BRICS, ASEAN, QUAD etc. with weights for individual CBDCs and seamless conversion. Is it possible or just a pipe dream"
490,Thanks Akshay for touching and making us literate on topics which I think nobody covers. Your way of explaining things is great and best line is   quot to cut the long story in short  quot ..... Great work... Keep it up...
491,"UPI became successful only after opening Jan Dhan Bank account for each and every citizen till the ground level and  I'mplementing Demonetization after that, then after citizens forced to adopt this change and now it became a success story. Everything was well thought and planned."
492,worst policy I think so
493,"Our economy is in such a bad shape spending printed money  that    's worth nothing . We have so much to pray about .. You    've helped me and my family With your advices  I'magine investing $ 1000 and receiving $ 8,350 in few days with Ms Ana this inflation has increased drastically investment is the best idea"
494," I'm buying more US stocks.Taxes are crazy high Save your taxes with TaxBuddy.Indian markets are expected to grow, check my Smallcases."
495,Great analysis and Kudos to you for being honest in such difficult times Initially I thought you are trying to sell CBDC but thanks for being rationale on such a sensitive topic. I hope the reg I'me will not push it forcefully otherwise it will be Noteban 2.0.
496,Gov. Just found the recent crypto crash a way to introduce the CBDC so they could try and regulate the crypto world. And it is not just India plenty other countries are trying to introduce their form of CBDCs. The motto might be to control the crypto transactions and it might help tax those who have invested invested in Bitcoin and Etherium and other coins.
497,"The main advantage as I understand is adding smart contracts to CBDC which prevents the misuse of subsidies  crop loans etc., For example, bank offers crop loan  AG Loan to farmers at a subsidized interest rate and this is getting credited to bank account or given in cash  this is being utilised in a wrong way i.e instead of using that money for agriculture purpose  they are using this for purchasing luxury items or childs education etc., i.e using it for anything other than agriculture (in most cases). So if smart contracts are introduced to CBDC this can be prevented. using smart contracts it can be programmed in such a way that it can be utilised for purchasing only to which its intended for . Please feel free to correct me incase of my above understanding is incorrect."
498,"Hi, great analysis on CBDC. From where I am looking at it seems like the government is trying to el I'minate physical cash from the economy. This also points to lesser instances of black cash getting stashed."
499,"Great video, Akshat.   My two cents... 1. RBI Concept Note on CBDC does outline the challenges that you highlighted, so clearly the govt. has deliberated on the risks and challenges, esp, related to the intermediation on the role of banks vis-a-vis credit.... and 2. The pilot has just been launched, which would hopefully help identify these and also flush out the inefficiencies. Mr. Rajan is a wise man, but the collective wisdom of the current govt is equally good.   Keep making such videos, as it    's always nice to hear your point of view. Cheers"

504,"New week up as many FOMO in. But the gdp increases story isn’t over yet. The only strat that works under all circumstances is DCA all the time with solid, large companies (not hyped ones)."

Only using political and international  I'mages as thumbnail and title  reviewing policies and forecasting upcoming events aint providing any value near to those when we got company and brands case study. Youre taking shortcut and only running after numbers rather than providing any value of greater significance. Hope youll take this in consideration."

Everyone is under the mindset that govt should do something instead of you know thinking of How to  I'mprove things by themselves. So can you make a video on this. As part of the video, you can Explain the main problems with govt interference and Free Market Capitalism vs socialism. I think with respect to disadvantages of govt interference, you can take reference from Nobel Prize Winning Economist Milton Friedman. He has a whole Playlist related to this known as Free to Choose. I think you can use practical examples to explain about Free Markets, socialism and disadvantages with govt interference. You will get enough content for this  I'mO and this whole can be a series in and of itself. And I promise you watching Milton Friedmans videos will Enlighten you"

589,All is ok about the video but dont be so naive about the  I'mmigrants in Finland. Many of them face horrific racial abuses. Also how will expats transfer their currencies to India without SWIFT One option is for India to open their own banks or at least an intermediary bank account in all countries to which expats can transfer money and this Indian offshore bank or the bank account can then transfer the money to the Indian bank account. I doubt if the white  I'mperialist western countries will agree to any of this unless India puts more pressure on MasterCard and visa. Lastly think-tanks like Atlantic Council have anti-India agendas.

So moving to CBDC is a HUGE step in  I'mprovements."
607,Digital Rupee sounds way better than e-rupee...
608,I think you failed to mention the centralised nature of these CBDC tech. In these times where democracy is on the line CBDC will act as sniper rifles where you can blacklist the accounts and stop services for  the individuals or a group that the government dislikes.Apart from this the smart contracts are too much vulnerable and could be hacked....and if the governments used crosschain bridge for interacting with other cbdcs then it would be extremely vulnerable ........I think the best approach would be a decentralised currency with zero knowledge verification for the wallets.....pls ignore any typo mistakes..........suggesting you to make a video on defi(decentralised finance)...............btw nice work...

When the government give money directly to people, the whole country become innovative with any idea becoming a business venture.   Why not India try this"
669,"Every plus point given for CBDC can be done with the present system such as recording the transaction, works offline ( with cap ), alternative to cash, sending and receiving money ( but presently its costly )    So apart from transaction of money internationally cheaper but otherwise present system achieve same ...    Now this doesnt means that cbdc has no advantage but ur explanation doesnt make much justice  Need more clear knowledge to really understanding its advantage"

690,"In hands of good govt this is blessing and in hands of corrupt govt this system is a weapon. Through this system Govt can get access to all you financial transactions and records. If you speak against govt, they can put restrictions on your financial transaction and ability to take debt, which exactly what Chinese govt is doing. We should not blindly obey whatever govt tells us to do. We always have to be vigilant."

703,I agree to most of the solutions you provide but the reason of failure in india could be digital illiteracy and the cyber cr I'mes happening ...on a daily basis just through digital transaction crores of rupeee theft is been done by con men ...so this needed to be adressed first
704,"Excellent video, I personally think the decentralized clearing system is the most efficient and promising. Black money GDP in India is almost equal to official GDP, if this can be solved using CBDC, it would be a game changer."
705,We should first  I'mplement the digital currency to fucking politicians by banning there actually currency.
706,Ok with refugees part but in India context you have missed the most  I'mportant application of CBDC is to takle Black Money...     Therefore India part is useless. And lack of information.. people are unbanked but with internet.what a useless after Jan dhan drive
707,"In your example, at the end of day,  HDFC needs to transfer 150 crores to ICICI.  Do they physically transfer 150 crores of paper currency I am assuming that HDFC and ICICI has accounts in RBI  and RBI subtracts 150 crores from HDFC account and add it to ICICI. So, everything happened electronically. What did e-rupee do extra  In USA, we use physical currency very rarely. We use credit, debit cards most of the time. I did not feel any drawbacks for not having e-dollar. Looks like I did not understand e- rupee well"
708,Does that mean at the day end 150₹ crore  will transfered physically from one to another

745,If this then what will happen to the banks
746,If CBDC will give compitition to swift then it will be very useful for india
747,I think you did not do the quarterly compounding while showing the interest calculation
748,Blockchain is the future
749,"Please compare more sensibly, when you are showing difference in interest income quaterly vs monthly, you should have shown it with same interest of 4%.  So the difference would be of Rs20,000 and Rs20,371."

752,"The problem of Fiat currency is incessant money printing. The so called cbdc is another such rfiat currency which is unlikely to solve the main problem of our economy. Moreover, introduction of cbdc will permit the government to record every transaction made by a citizen and if necessary the ruling dispension can easily create problems for a citizen who does not tow the official line. Such interventionist situation already exist in China.  A Chinese citizen not in the good book of the authorities has to face severe consequences by carb on his economic freedom."

755,"3 points I didnt like in this video, I hope youll correct it  1. Western Union doesnt charge very high conversion rates or transfer rate. I transfer frequently and it turns to be around a diff of 40paise per dollar, and the transfer fee is flat 0.99$ no matter the amount.  2. Most of the time I receive the amount instantly even when the amount is in the range of lakhs.  3. You calculated the savings interest in case of HDFC bank compounded annually, but it should be quarterly, and the amount should come to be slightly more than 15000. But you did calculate the savings interest of IDFC bank compounded monthly, I wonder why such discr I'mination Is it because you wanted to highlight the difference for your sponsor"

771,I hope we win the race somehow Seems amazing
772,CBDC will revolutionize the digital payment system once the pilot project proves to be successful.  We have still millions of people who have no access to Banking services though our country has made a tremendous progress in bringing most of the people to access the services of Banks over the years.  The Digital currency is supposedly more secure than transacting through Apps under UPI as it cannot be easily hacked as it has many security layers.  As the time passes it will prove to be a boon to the common people also.
773,Wonderfully explained
774,Shout out to Thala Ajith   Great video by the way
775,first time saw bank promoting in youtubers
776,If it is CENTRALIZED it is BAD. If it is DESCENTRALIZED its good for us the people. Why Because centralized gives them yet again all the control. Unlike the btc which cannot s I'mply be created unlimited and endlessly forever. Its limited and no one has control but everyone has control of it. In essence making all who own it the bank themselves. Centralized will be just as it is today.. money will depreciate more and more.. So.. you tell me what is best

781, I'may be wrong but what we are witnessing in  modijis era is certainly have never happened and probably we wouldnt see this in near future no matter who comes.
782,This thing can be used for evil. Giving any government more power to manipulate your currency is reckless. These CBDCs will give tyrants the fine grain power of shutting off someones ability to even conduct transactions. Absolutely evil
783,thanks for explaining this so lucidly
784,19th century India is always American propaganda media with fake news country all the times so India  is lagging 150years  behind China and USA now
785,"i have a doubt bro,you said that by using CBDT a person can send offline and without having a bank account  and how it is possible without a bank account how do that person have money in his account and how can he transfer money 🤷‍♂️"
786,This not going to work..the copy cat of crypto by govt never succeed... See my article below
787,It could reduce creation of credit money based on underlying money with banks
788,Request. Pls turn off the background sound.
789,Correction in example used to explain current transaction system     HDFC sent 250 cr to ICICI and ICICI sent 100 cr to HDFC then at EOD ICICI will send 150 cr to HDFC
790,wait you said that 100 crore transaction takes around 3-4 days...... but in crypto it can be done in 30minutes max.....
791,Bro please post a video on what will happen if  and  go for  a war
792,new intro music is dope
793,The whole point of a blockchain is to have a decentralized system that a small group of people dont control. A government controlled blockchain is analogous to a horse pulling a car whose engine has been removed.
794,Seeing the current scams the checks and balances are not in place in banks. Now this new system will complicate things.
795,Anyone knows what is the global agenda on controlled currency through digital currency... With out the permission  of the authority no one able to use money .. all is  I'maginary
796,Digital rupee is not good for people and the government. Because it cam be hacked by other countries like Russia and pakistan. These new types of money exchange is not good and not secured.

801,"Bro thank you so much, you are literally educating and changing meaning of schools"
802,"I dont think it is the time for digital rupee because most of the Indians are nit sustainable in both education and lifestyle even now with increase in inflation, decrease of rupee over dollar. This govt think of only 10% as if the 10% can make India a developed country. The answer is no, because if there is no money for 90% people of India, then what in in India futures be."
803,"But its not decentralized though right.... And isnt that purpose of the blockchain   Plus isnt digitizing currency an easy way to handover control to an authoritarian govt.... I hope I dont come across as rude.... Genuinely puch rha hu, thanks."
804,"The issue is, indias methods for a SWIFT replacement are too complicated. When I use swift through axis bank the money gets transferred right away to my account based in UK. If I use the SWIFT through icici, indian bank(govt) the process is too complicated because they literally ask for proofs of income like gift deed, salary slip of last 6 months and some other stupid proofs. Money in bank is 100% white, why make process difficult I understand if its for big transactions like 1 crore+, but even for small transactions like 1lakh there is way to many documentation from indian side. If anyone has been to west, will know how easy and seamless the process through SWIFT is. IF RBI can match that, they can definitely become big, if they keep things complicated like how it is right now I dont think they can even dent SWIFT"

826,"Dont believe a word of this central bank digital currency is all about control. Banks will know all about your business, you will lose the ability to make transactions without BIG BROTHER knowing about it, TOTAL FINANCIAL CONTROL.

835,Thanks for the overview... Topic right now
836,I was super confused about how the digital money transfer from account differs from RBIs e-rupee and never got it cleared till I watched your video. Superb Explanation Really glad that this channel exists
837,If everyone could send money without bank account why would anyone in future open a bank account. And what is the role of banks and how could they make money
838,"haha, Chinas issue is exactly that they cannot make money readily available because itll change the existing balance of power really fast. It only empowers selected individuals that will not be threat to party and cannot let money fall into some other figure that they cannot trust. They just s I'mply cannot take that sort of thing. This insane paranoia of losing power is a living reality of China. They are 100% fine with corruption because they can use alot of their people as scapegoats but they cannot actually start being fair and just because theyll end up losing power and this exact thing is going to stop them from actually being people friendly. They want to control peoples life, their wealth, their property, their sex life even. Power and Dominance has always been their thing, empowering people is always ever going to be selective and on their terms."
839,"Thanks for sharing the positives of CBDC but you forget to mention the cons     further surveillance, know where when and what exactly you are spending your money on  Data farming  The government can freeze your account easily of they dont agree with your political views  ."
840,"All this already exists via different cryptocurrencies. The problem with CBDC, is that it can easily be used to create dictatorships around the world.  I'm shocked the creator of this video did not consider that obvious outcome"
841,"Well explained, you are the person who makes me to understand most of the topics so s I'mple. The way of explaining through example is marvelous. Great work bro.  Now in this topic, how it controls bribe and black money"
842,IF A FEW INCIDENTS OF HECKING CUSTOMERS WALLETS WILL BE NOTICED THAN ATTRACTION FOR DIGITAL CURRENCY WILL DISAPPEAR...
843,I did not understand it. It was too technical.
844,But what abt exchange rate fluctuations
845,Its a very good Idea.
846,The only thing  I'm afraid of is cyber cr I'me. Our Government should invest in cyber security as well. Going online is good but being vulnerable is not good at all.
847,I hope this initiative can wipe out physical currency and el I'minate all gray market transactions. and eventually stop corruption.
848,The 3rd option is the ult I'mate goal ....it has the potential to dethrone petrodollar ....reduce the dependence on $
849,"hi bro I have three questions  1 As you gave first example, I suppose digital rupee isnt block chain based and i didnt understand the logic of first example. but i remember for this example government has started tocken QR code which could be used for scholarship.  2 so in future we wouldnt have to have bank account or there wont be any bank  3 as currency change or cross border transaction technology is still in process, digital rupee may help as no bank system required. what could be more practical use of digital rupee  Thank you for these very informative and lovely videos."
850,Ye sab toh theek h tax kab lenge sab logo se
851,Our government will make in favor of the their own and political community
852,I am getting a little confused here. If the transactions under CBDC will happen at Central banks level what will be left for the banks to work for
853,And they say... What has modi done He is doing what congress taught waste of time.
854,"poor video not explaining why CBDCs are horrendous,giving complete control of our money to governments."
855,"Somehow I get the feeling that the present government needs to remain in power to  I'mplement this (and all the benefits of this) in a reasonable timeline without wasting any time. Anyway, how many of you think India can beat China in this race"
856,Best video so far. } Thanks
857,"Think School Can You make a Video On How the Money is created, Who controls it and how the Federal Bank of U.S. is affecting the Economy of whole World"

862,st    up    id Indians will gladly be  come s  lave  s
863,"They are massive disadvantages that come with CBDC. And I believe its  I'mportant for you to explain this issue in another video. This initiative was not founded on the basis of protecting citizens but rather tighten control of the   a   masses.it    masses.it    a   will become apparent, because government will have enormous powers to do exactly what they want at any given time. Why Because they can exclude you from all economic activities altogether indefinitely if you do not do what they want. And that is maybe a price we have to pay unfortunately."
864,Will this affect retail Forex trading
865,not a good idea
866,Yeah it can because Russia is also developing something s I'milar so I guess its a coordinated approach between different countries and this isnt something developed in the last hour
867,"And why not use the CBDC in restricting the first time user of reservations  caste quota  in India by a person from a certain community. Track them and block them after one-time usage of reservations in jobs, education, welfare schemes, promotions in govt. jobs etc.. Can this be practically  I'mplemented in such scenario I wonder...."
868,"There are many cons of CBDC.  No privacy, total authoritarian reg I'me. Govt can montor every transection  can block any transection.   CBDC is coming in all countries. CBDC is the idea of  I'mf and wef. These institutions are pressing every govt to bring CBDC.  I'mf and wef is owned by very powerful people on earth. And they want to remain in power and to do so they dont want this (debt based, crippled) financial system to change. Bitcoin is the threat to current financial system and the powerful people has only one last card to play thats CBDC."
869,The question lies that why will india adopt to digital rupee and go through pain of change of process of transactions system with upi availability
870,But cbdc can rise terrorism

Awesome  Keep making such informational   amp highly knowledgable content     Quick Suggestion - Please change the background music as per the category of narration content.

Thank you

899,"We have mobile apps on retails banks now, why would you need a CBDC in the Bahamas, still no need to go to the banks As a side note, I used to work for a company making core banking engine, where we already had smart contracts, so even that is already here. Blockchain technology  I'mplies distributability, which is not inherent to CBDC, quite the opposite. I think this video is missing a point about the control that CBDCs give to central governments, which is a major concerns given the world we leave in and the decision being taken by government and non-government organization. CBDCs remove so much friction, the question is would you trust your own government with so much power"
900,nice
901,Sorry to say this but there is no significant advantage of this digital currency. The example of refugees is a black swan event so it doesnt really weigh in as a great usecase. Using a digital currency makes sense for a weakly connected country like Bahamas but not for India.

913,"It is nicely explained, except I did not follow one thing. In case of UPI the video explains that the delta of the transaction is transferred between the banks at the end of the day. How is that not the case in the case of the CBDCs Why do the CBDC rupees directly transfer between customer account and merchant account. Can  School or anyone explain"

Thanks for it.    Also, this form of RBI digital currency will drastically reduce hoarding of physical money, evaded from paying tax as well as illegally earned through several unlawful things.

This is the problem with business-oriented channels they discuss case studies without worrying about the details. And 10 or 20 years later, when the systems flaws start affecting ordinary people, then everyone will wonder how people were so stupid to begin with. Smart contracts have serious security issues. Blockchain makes an economy extremely energy-dependent (something India needs to always  I'mport). Ledgers provide detailed intelligence about any individual to anyone who can access it. The list of problems goes on and on and on ... and the only people worried about these problems are the computer scientists who know about it.

992,"CBDC is the digital prison in which the several decades of Indias debt to the international Banks is going to continue. This is nothing new. Instead of the debt in paper currency which could be printed in billions without any gold backing by a switch is now going to be in virtual digital system without any gold backing much more worse than the paper currency. Atleast paper currency you can be sure you hold it and spend it on what ever you wish for. But CBDC can be switched on or off from your account any time the government wishes. CBDC can control what you spend on, and who can spend it and who does not depending on your credit score."

1016,"No need to celebrate early, just observe for the time being, it is in pilot phase. Also, we talk and hype things up but the end result is often tame.  Eg 1. Demonetization, some of my relatives genuinely expected 10 lakh or something as promised by the govt.  2. Start- up the new revolution, look at the current status, no start up ecosystem has benefitted the ordinary folks.  3. 5 trillion economy by 2025, there was a book or something written on it, what is the status  4. UPI, but company are in loss, govt compensation is not sufficient.  There are endless examples.  We are 5th largest economy on paper, but the standard of living has not increased, its skewed towards the industrialists."

1020,"No need to be getting high on this. If this is happening at the same time as other national banks, then this is decided by an external entity. Like WEF.   Now this digital currency will be a control system on where the money is spent and by whom .  Like the banks can decide if you spend on food or drugs.   And this can spiral down whne the political will is against the nation.   Banks might not alow you to spend your money on something whcih is against the then narrative.   Like you cant fund a opposition party if the governing party dont want you to.   If the govt thhinks and NGO is against the govt, theyll never be allowed to collect cash.   You can extrapolate easily.   This will be bad.move"

So govt can issue any number of these funny money and continue its rewadi culture to win votes. Also they can pass this to common people in the form of inflation. And give as much credit to people who are connected with banks and politicians as they are all generated - not earned
1025,Kya e-upi corruption khatam kar dega
1026,"CBDT is a waste of time. It is designed by the Governments to diverrt people away from blockchain. Currency is already digital, we already have UPI. I can already pay online. CBDT just would make RBI do something that it is not equipped to do - create individual accounts. If people can save their money in RBI account, why on earth would they use any other bank So it will kill banking as we know it. It will be a maintenance nightmare for the RBI and a terrible tragedy for the banks."
1027,Very nice article. But I believe this is more relevant for the cbdc retail which is yet to be launched. Also wouldn’t this disintermediate the banks from the financial system which in turn will increase systemic risk on rbi itself. Banks also help create money supply by giving loans which the rbi will be unable to fulfill. Just my thoughts
1028,in todays era no fiat backed by any commodity
1029,India being a huge net  I'mporter has only one factor in its favour of being a huge market for other countries to sell their products in India. How this situation which is not going to change for the better in near future would drive India to become a Super Power

1054,i dont see any benefits of CBDC. it is just like UPI and even in UPI you can make offline payments. also he gave an example of some remote island who is using CBDC which is not relatable to our indian context. in my opinion CBDC is a new fancy and expensive project which govt  doesnt understand and is going to cost our economy more than demonetization

1088,I think cbdc dark side is that it gives too much control to the government. They can track each and every transaction and penalize or reward us based   quot good behavior  quot according to them.    I think upi system is good.    Cbdc will be good initially- maybe first few years but later this will become a tool to control everyone.    Let us not forget that east india company came in with the supposed intention of doing trade in india. Once they gained some trust we know what happened next.     Let us not get fooled again and again.    Although it would be our own government who would be dictating us but then we wont be a free country anymore. On paper we will be but in reality we will not.    It may seem like a doomsday scenario but this will happen I can see this unfolding again in future because there are so many instances in the past of the same although happening in different ways.    Let us do a little reseach on our own about history.

1098,"I didnt understand how we can transfer money between two parties using CBDC without internet connectivity.

1101,"A little more concept or info needed sir,"
1102,"Amazing presentation. However, I think I couldnt follow from step 1.   Today, the settlements between banks are delayed (say 1 day or a week). What exactly is the drawback of this delay As far as accounting  ledger is concerned its updated instantly. So, every calculation that needs to be done subsequently, would not be  I'mpacted by the delay.     Secondly, how to banks settle Do they need to Physically carry 150 Crores (from the example) from Place A to Place B Or is this a digital thing"

1105,"JFYI ( since you have zero clue how swift works ) - FUNDS are transferred instantly within seconds to Nostro accounts of Indian banks, which do not settle  I'mmediately because of their inefficiency, corruption, and greed. Because of the time difference and the fact that the Indian rupee is not freely tradeable, it takes time for settlement in the beneficiary account. Additionally, because of stupid laws and regulations in India, banks use them as an excuse to delay further credit in beneficiary accounts.     Finally, it does not take five days."

1130,Thanks for explaining cbdc.  I have a doubt The example given on the interest earning in idfc Bank vs other banks must consider same rate of interest snd benefits based on monthly interest payments by idfc vs quarterly payments by other banks.   Comparing 4%interest vs 3% as in the example given is comparing Apples and Oranges.

1242,So these CBDC will have their own blockchains I guess. This seems to be a death blow to bank as these will bypass them. One fear compared to cash is that these digital rupee can be withdrawn at any time when the government seems right at the push of a button.That sort of centralized control is not good. If some misuses power UR networth can be zero overnight. Anyone who opposes the government  may be targeted like opposition  or human rights groups.

1248,"Wish you had spoken a bit about the cons of CDBC. There is a reason central banks shouldn’t be given supreme power. For ex, Twitter shuts down accounts of people who do not share their views. Central bank can do the same with CDBC.   The current UPI is working brilliantly for remote users. We already have an efficient digital platform for small users. There is no clear explanation on how CDBC will reduce cross border payment commissions.   It is very dangerous for central banks to get into credit ratings and loan disbursals. Why don’t you just sell of the country to Adani and Ambani . They are already getting unlimited loans through the current setup.   May be my understanding of CDBC is wrong  but it feels like D means dictator here"
1249,"Awesome explainer You really continue to  I'mpress me young man. Kudos to you.    I would add 2 other  I'mportant aspects that will prove to be critical to the financial health of a country - CBDC’s will enable the Indian government to aid, support and subsidize its population during extreme times of crisis (like the pandemic) but limit spending to nominated suppliers preventing unnecessary foreign exchange erosion when this aid money is abused for purchasing goods from outside the country or for unnecessary goods.     Additionally, India’s large population and its ability to deploy easily a rupee based CBDC (given its mobile phone penetration, ID card  I'mplementation, its population’s familiarity with e payments) will augur well for the Indian rupee exchange rates - as its able to maintain a large and healthy demand of CBDC across the globe (for starters the USD 81 B) remittance not even taking into account all the export trade based on CBDC"

1264,"1  I am not still clear what are the advantages of CBDC over what we have now. For example, there is no CBDC at present in Canada, however, I can send money to anyone in Canada going to the website of my bank and initiating a transfer by using the Canada wide system called InterAc. All one needs is the receivers email. Nothing else.The transfer is made without banks human intervention the sender gets an email that the money is sent aa well as when it is accepted by the other party likewise, the receiver gets an email advising the transfer. Where is the advantage of CBDC  2  Excuse me but When you compare IDFC and others, isnt the illustration of the benefits of monthly interest credits v. quarterly rather misleading since you aggregate that with the higher IDFCs rate of 4% v 3% Perhaps you could have said that benefits of monthly v. quarterly credits on Rs 5 lakh deposited is Rs371  per year, the rest being due to higher rates offered by IDFC. Just to be fair to your listeners.   Thank You."

Never saw a bank reducing their charges, they feed on only charges, let alone the remittance charges.   So now, we can get salaries also through digital currency"

1279,"A central bank digital currency is a double edged sword. You can talk all day long about benefits but at the end of the day the Government in the country that issues digital currency has a complete view of every single transaction done by the individual .. even more so it can control how much you spend on your purchases because the Government can label it as environment unfriendly or whatever reason if it wants to or is forced to by bigger more powerful Governments    I am not  I'mpressed with the story of Finnish refugees... This is just a smoke screen to enact digital currency ult I'mately for not just refugees but all the citizens of Finland... The refugees program is a Beta test more likely    Ult I'mately the problem of fiat currency doesnt go away just because you went digital... The fundamental problem remains... you are printing money out of thin air with nothing to actually back it up...the digital currency will put an end to the pretense that we are actually using money.. we are s I'mply making changes to ledger entries.. instead of physically printing cash from nowhere, the Government will print it electronically.."
1280," No physical damage. As opposed to the currency notes, there is no risk of damaging a digital rupee by way of wear and tear or losing it during movement."
1281,Thank you sir for this  vital information which may cause disruption in future financial transaction.

1293,Tbh sir.....from what i have observed and understand this system will not much effective for us middle class ones    Although it can help our country in longer terms but the refugees in india are from mostly the countries where they have been violated and their first priority is food and shelter so how can they even think to buy smartphone for CBDC and how this is effective for us middle class      I'm not opposer of any party but i just want to hear both sides of CBDC (pros are there but are the cons) please explain sir... Thank you
1294,Can it be called indian govt bitcoin or its same as our indian currency it value will not vary.
1295,If CBDC is not backed by some physical asset then its a threat. Everything else is good.

1299,Pleased try to make another video on this CBDC topic. Its really helpful.
1300,but what if I hack the digital currency and just copy paste it into millions
1301,"Thanks, best content for getting started on CBDC. You can add what is CBDC in your title because you totally explain it and it deserves a header, might reach more international audiance."
1302,One line answer to your question. India can never destroy the SWIFT network.
1303,"Also, the govt can keep a direct tracking on every single Rupee transaction being done anywhere in the country and outside. With time, what you consider a rupee (a stock variable) will stop being relevant, only the transaction will be of value. Your stock of Rupees in the bank or a wallet will be a temporary point in the series of these transactions. Backed by a blockchain. When physical currency ends, you can no longer hoard it. Right now, you might decide to give Rs. 5000 to your maid in cash, the govt cant exactly track it. Govt just has an overall idea of how much money is in circulation in the country, they dont know WHO has it or had it in the past. Digital currency will forever put your ownership stamp in these flow of transactions.     Also sometime in future - spending limits on every aspect of life can be pre-decided ( I'm not saying they will be - but the possibility will be there).     But then, future generations will be born and raised in such a world so they wont mind it, because theyve never seen the previous levels of financial freedom.     Also, if youre a common person going about your everyday life, it wouldnt affect you individually, it could only affect you as a part of a group. But if you every have an opinion against the govt.. well, just know that there will be a magical option to make all your money disappear from the systems.  I'm not saying it WILL happen, but the possibility for it to happen has been created."
1304,CBDCs are going to destroy the free market

1309,"Although  I'm glad about the steps govt is taking related to digital currency,  I'm worried not much is spoken about the security aspects   amp  the measures they are taking. For example, Aeps related frauds are getting more rampant even though people havent shared any details about their Aadhar. I hope govt brings more awareness on security aspect.    As usual, great video Keep going"
1310,They should first take care of Inflation rather passing time with such exper I'ments
1311,This will help us now doing inflight payments for our food and beverages.
1312,"RBI should work out with foreign central bank in their particular countries to allow SBI and other nationalised bank in foreign countries to easily transfer money from n to different countries. There no need of SWIFT transaction. Eg, Mr A who have account in SBI in England should have the same unique ID bank account in India, he should easily do transaction by removing Swift transaction"

1328,"Wow. A whole video about CBDC without talking about the serious drawback of giving complete control of your data and money to the government To anyone who reads this, please do your research on the drawbacks of CBDCs.  I'magine giving control of your money to the worst politician in India, whoever it may be. You have no control over your money."

But possible ofcourse under the BRICS cooperation between, India, China, Russia, Brazil, South Africa. Plus those countries applying membership in brics and in pending approval including Saudi Arabia, Argentina and Latin America (not the US America). Thats the reason Putin did his best to avoid conflict at all cost from one Asia to another Asian countries and United us as he is the only person who knows about US and West policy, plan and almost every details. United we stand, divide we fall."
1345,guess what India is bringing social credit
1346,Not even in the next 100 years
1347,Used to love this channel before it became advertising campaign for the government
1348,A lot of misinformation - not many understand money.
1349,CBDC is gona be the biggest ponzi.. its gona take away your privacy and rights.. just think.. its centralized and controlled by the goverment coders.. they can change anything and anytime they want. they can censor anyone even for petty things if u talk against the govt. CBDC is the ponzi and Bitcoin is the pin.. protect your privacy guys.. there is a thin line between privacy and secrecy.. just think.. and we want privacy nor secrecy..
1350,"Talking about success of UPI, one should never forget that it was a failed exercise enforced upon Indians through malpractices such as demon-etisation for which Indians paid with cancelled marriages, loss in businesses and even losses of life while trying to withdraw their own money - something which the current govt is fully responsible for and yet the leaders ( I'mage of one such leader is proudly displayed in your thumbnail, great work) sleep peacefully without their conscience kicking in.    For the govt to recreate the success of UPI in the form of CBDC, it has to replicate the same steps of creating forced  I'mplementation of the new financial system and an artificial mass chaos something like a war, which we are already witnessing in Europe.    Given the current trend of the govt, its a rare chance that it will not enforce another financial system on the lay man. Having said that, open source block chain fin tech and cryptos will sooner or later defeat CBDCs."

1353," I'mportant to keep in mind US$ has two d I'mensions that is embedded in global trade, investment, financing as well as huge part of the Central banking reserve system. All fiat, notes or digital is only backed by a GOVt, called FIAT money. There is US$ in the US and there is the so called EURO DOllar system, started in the 70s with petro dollars. Indian experts need to keep this mind. To min I'mize the role of USD in trade, investments and banking is no easy task....Even now, Chinese currency is not part of global trade, investments and banking."
1354,"The money in bank account accumulates  interest. The digital Ruppee will be like cash. So people will continue using bank accounts and with that NEFT and  I'mPS transactions. When different banks will be involved again there will be backend clearance. To make this work, banks might also have to use some clearance mechanism in form of Digital rupee transfer with one another.    So perhaps there will be two type of digital transactions.  1. The new Digital cash eRuppee  transaction  2. The traditional NEFT    I'mPS built on framework for Digital eRuppee transactions between banks."
1355,How does CBDC work offline without internet

1364,IDFC First will create customer base by giving services at low or no cost later theyll start charging just like other banks do. This is one of the strategy.
1365,"This kind of exaggeration using words like   quotdestroy  quot to promote the video is unnecessary.  You already have enough followers. No need to use dramatic titles like tv news channels.

1378,"So CBDC is belonging to a government bank, correct What profit will it make through the transactions If all the transactions go instantly the bank dont have time to use the money through its own investment manipulation to get more profit. Am I right And when the bank A of one country sends the money to the bank B of another country will there be any transaction percentage (and who will pay it) or they will make profit trough dif currency rate"
1379,Super Info.
1380,i dont understand the credit score transfer system because how they verify that the person is taking loan from another person . may be they wanna convert the cash in digital format
1381,"6.58 - please send some peace loving communities to finland, theey will be even more happier."
1382,"Just to add here. Regarding the delay in crediting transferred funds internationally, as you mentioned in earlier days it used to take 2 to 3 working days. But now payments are credited instantly to Indian bank accounts from foreign banks. Especially from Middle eastern regions.     It wouldnt take more than 5 to 10 mins in anytime of the day including weekends and public holidays."
1383,"What I dont understand is, where the CBDC transfered money will be stored if one doesnt have bank account."

1397,"I was part of one such CBDC exper I'ment.  I would suggest to cover the risks involved like bank run, key loss - in case you make another video "
1398,Yes
1399,You are right your presentation is very accurate
1400,"The one thing that you did not cover are the disadvantages of CBDC and how it can be misused by governments. For example, the Chinese government which is known for its oppression of some Musl I'm communities can completely block off their access to certain goods and services. The policy making with respect to subsidies will be controlled by politicians and will be used by them to control their vote bank. This is especially not good in a country like India."
1401,Unemployment shows how much we are growing
1402,"Will bank have any relevance for day to day transections if this is used  I think the banking system currently will cease to have any relevance in transections and will be only limited towards providing other financial services like (loans, offers, etc.)  What are your views on it"
1403,That was really very informative video. And the concept of CBDC is great but I was also thinking about its  I'mpact on the earnings of the current banks as most of the banks charge fees for the transactions carried out by them. Also will that also makes banks obsolete in a way  Please share your thoughts on this
1404,"Superb summary. Specifics on the Chinese model that is leading the race please, if possible. Where are India and USA in this race So, block chain is essential and fundamental to this"

1412,Please make a video on Singapores Economic Success . An island country in one generation went from a developing to a developed economy.
1413,"Cbdc’s aren’t money. They are fiat currency’s. We don’t use money anywhere in the world, it’s illegal. We use fiat currency’s, forced upon us.     Central banks are a tenant of communism  socialism. Same with income tax. Same with government schooling."
1414,"Central banks have been the enemy of nations since the beginning of time. Many holes in this video. The country’s people that stays away from cbdc’s will prosper the most, the ones with it will be in serfdom  slavery to the centralized authoritarians."

How refugees will have access to aadhar card    Even if we consider the case of getting the wallet top-up with the cash to fund the CBDC wallet, the problem to the areas where the hard cash cannot be delivered or delay in getting delivered."

1455,"Great video. Loved your s I'mple explanation.   However some concepts still need clarity mainly  1. Gold, silver back the currency issued by Central Bank. Digital currency is backed by what What if there is cyber theft as seen in many crypto accounts What if there is some mistake like overissue of currency since this currency is not backed by gold   amp silver.   2. A smart tech, global consensus and high trade vol.  is needed to be the best digital currency. Is there something more  I would love to see a second part on this."
1456,Good video - WB appreciates your work.
1457,CBDC payment system work to shibainu ecosystem and shib block chain technology
1458,adai yena da ak vachu fun panringa
1459,I also have another question. Since remittance is a big source of income for India. Lets assume US resident wants to transfer money to India. He goes to SBI in NY. Money recieved in dollars by SBI stays with the bank and can be used for Indian  I'mport settlement with US. Digital Indian currency is credited by SBI in Indian recipients account. Its a book transfer instead of real. Is this right for digital currency  Normally banks buy currency from market at prevailing exchange rate for transfer. They also hedge. Hence process takes time (3-5 days).
1460,"The financial system is already a known Ponzi scheme. Its better to also talk about the cons of CBDC. Youve made it look like the best thing to adopt by a common man. Weve given too much control to the Government already, is it healthy to give more control of our human rights. Well be dependent on the government after this. Dont you realise the speed at which the government supplied COVID vaccination to the entire country, but why was it so inefficient when it was about polio or malaria vaccination It basically shows that the Government has its own agenda. Were basically factory workers in a corporation, where were not allowed to know corporate strategies and secrets. They provide for you, so you can contribute to the economy (or the SYSTEM). I know there are some absurd conspiracy theorists, who talk about flat earth, but some conspiracies are more of a fact than theory. In fact science is based on theory. You can be among the ignorant if you choose to. There is nothing to be proud of the current monetary system, its purely a scam, even the economist agrees to this 100%. Its designed to be so complicated to understand, so no ordinary man can figure it out. If everyone realises the truth, therell be a bankrun. The monetary system will collapse the next day."
1461,Superb video
1462,"Hey quick questions 1. Do all digital currencies work on DL  Blockchain technology   2. How would the digital rupee work without internet connectivity How would the transaction be logged  3. Where    how will the digital currency be stored For normal bank-bank    upi transactions, the records are stored in the application through which the transactions are done and the bank account statements. For physical cash, the actual money changes hands. What happens in the case of digital currencies"
1463,one thing which i didt get the clarity is   this system method will help the indivisuals to make transactions without the   1.ATM  2.UPI  3. BANK ACCOUNT  now the question is without having bank account which consist money from which source the transaction will get executed.

So where this CBDC will be stored Who will be liable for the transactions Whom do the customers approach for the fraud cases How the interest, FD, PPF, etc will work And if its gonna replace the banks, where this bank people will go"
1474,"Do we have    own sufficient bandwidth for network required for mobile network, tv network, cable network, satellite communications and what not  Does having a payment portal like pay tm, e pay etc makes us enough competent to challenge International system like SWIFT  Does China or Russia or Taiwan or South Korea etc have ever attempted such step  Dont they have enough capablity to undertake such a step Or is this one more way to keep stupid bhakt bz to divert from my price rise, inflation, unemployment etc  Or just a Jumla as they would say after failure"
1475,"US Dollar has a backup of US Military, if anyone try to avoid the SWIFT network, they will attack. You can see it in the History. So Even if we make any software or hardware.

1483,The problem isn’t the cbdc but the rules behind it If govs start obliging ppl to use cbdc or it will expire in 3 months this means bye bye savings. One one side it’s good but on another is bad. If they demand the money to be spent because our social score level isn’t good enough for the system then we’re going to obey against our will and I call this MODERN SLAVERY
1484,"The intention is clearly to develop a system that is self reliant, made and owned by India, so that we are not held to ransom. IF That is going to replace something else, so be it. But destroying somebody elses   quotswift  quot was never the intention."

1486,"Explain around Finland, does not fully cover scenarios in India.     CBDC is a double edged sword Please make a video on what our countrys plan is around the technology concept and  I'mplementation.    Otherwise, this video is mostly above awareness of CBDC and its  I'mplementation in Finland and China."
1487,All those benefits already are there in existing crypto currencies like bitcoin. But yeah waste taxpayers money to create a new one so that power resides with these stupid corupt banks and govt who can now print money at will. Its a glorified dept trap which will come crashing sooner or later.

We all know that once a government establishes a rule, rarely, if ever, will roll it back.  This, therefore, is perceived as being a great progress and a great convenience, where, in reality, is a great menace to your personal freedom and your rights.  This menace applies to the peoples of India, China, USA, Russia Barbados, or   i  any    i   country on the planet.  The much touted transaction benefits can be done right now without money digitalization.  Besides, if you are an asylum seeker, and are fleeing a country where your identity is tied to the centralized money,   i  as    i     i  all    i     i  digitzed    i     i  money    i     i  will    i     i  be    i    your traceability is also  I'mmediate.

Bitcoin is a decentralized non governmental and non political option and gives one privacy. Furthermore, I hear CBDCS will limit one to only 50 Euros    Dollars per day expenditure. How will businesses work with population limited transaction able amounts this small  How does one pay for a car  or a house  or a boat  or other such expensive items when you are limited to only 50 Euros or Dollars a day  How long will it take to pay for a car worth say 60000 Euros or Dollars .

1594,"While you are praising the smart contracts and social score as positive, I see it as main threat of CBDC. Take example of China, when you connect digital currency with credit score you are headed into nightmare. While you can still handle cash, once the CBDC is introduced, you will lose ability of paying once your credit score is down. More  I'mportantly Central Bank will have possibility of switching you off with a s I'mple click. So for example if (due to your opinions) you become labelled with low social score - the Central bank can destroy your cash with one click.  However when you holding cash - the power of state (and Central bank) is quite small over you."

1651,well the thing what people dont seem to know is that finlands economy is completely screwed and gov is taking loan after loan after loan to pay all of it our gov loan was in 2008 54 billion 28% GDP in 2021 is  128billion 58% GDP all our basic services are drowning healthcare is in complete crisis eldercare services are more close to concentration camps and even prisoners are getting better food than elderly people who most of the time have to decide paying their medicine or food. its a complete disgrace   and our employments rates are higher than ever in our history and prizes have gone up approx 30-40% and will increase but none of the benefits to fin people have not and the salaries have not rise in years and the current gov keeps taking more and more loans and keeps paying every other countries loans and etc etc. So yeah refugees are doing great put fin people are suffering and loosing everything and the current goverment is formed mostly of the parties that people voted the most less. Absolutely no 1 is investing to finland because of the taxes and companies are leaving or going bankrupt constantly. Rich people and refugees are doing great but everyone else are loosing everything

1667,"Not convinced.   1. Subsidy and Direct Transfer to account is already happening in ration   gas cylinders etc. It is already a hit.  2. Mostly everyone has bank account after Jan Dhan. Its hard to  I'magine someone who doesnt have a bank account, and thus, doesnt have UPI, but that same person will start using CBDC.    Working offline (how) is one great advantage. Maybe it is done to ease work of RBI    system."
1668,I am almost certain that the currency isnt backed by anything these days   amp gold  silver standard was abolished decades ago. No
1669,I dont understand ur   a   explanation.how    explanation.how    a   do we fill our wallet without bank account
1670,I want to hug Modi ji in over happyness

1674,"YES, OUR SONS SUFFERED, WERE TARGETED, YES. DO YOUR SHARE   amp DO IT NOW, spread the word, WE ARE seeking SUITABLE brides forour sons Kaviraj  ampShilpi future POTUS, world dramastage, meFIRED jobsBLOCKED"
1675,"Very informative Bro, thanks.     I would like your opinions on Ripple XRP on CBDC. Will XRP ledger will be used for money transfer between countries specifically India   amp China"
1676,this year we will make $ 100 billion in remittance
1677,Does it mean everyone has to hold an electronic device to carry out transactions
1678,IDFC First Bank charges ₹25k MAB.
1679,World Government will end up in ONE DIGITAL CURRENCY and ONE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.    May be this will take many years.   Also I believe person will carry a micro-chip in their body so that no body can manipulate.
1680,I learned a lot from this video n with that a lesson too.
1681,Is there going to be a wallet for keeping this e rupi will we get interest or we just have to exchange our money from bank in the form of this digital currency
1682,great thing
1683,"India is facing problems like NIRAV MODIs    Vijay Mallya and many other willful defaulters. In order to control the flow of money, and restrict that money movement across national frontiers - the Govt in future will release all business Loans in the form of digital rupee.. This step if succeeded will curtail money turning BLACK..  The CBDC loans can be used for all purposes by corporates... Such loans can not be used by corporates for purposes other than the ones as specified in the digital contract."
1684,Interesting
1685,This is a great video
1686,This information is not valid now. not consistent with this document
1687,"CBDC has more negative consequences than any benefits. Gov is just trying to be in the digital currency race so they dont loose control. If gov can not control the money they cant control the people. Lets not gloryfy this CBDC thing and move towards the decentralisation. since its our money, we will decide how we keep it. People should be tired of government   banks deciding what one can do with his  her money.   If china is the first country to  I'mplement something, it cant be any good for the people.  Crypto is the future and truly decetralised. Everything that a gov controls is just part of modern slavery. Period    Edit- you wont hear other side of story of everything because of youtube censorship. Who controls youtube"
1688,"I dont think  China will become Economic Super Power like US as India is now Absolutely becoming Supreme in International Financia Matters, International Trade,  International Diplomacy, Local Political Issues, Military Expansion and in Adopting Newer Ideas and Tech in all Areas a Nation needs do at first."
1689,As a Indian  banks in PM Modi government in india is  I'mpossible. Save money  to Live on 2023 and 2024 year . U will Excel in 2025.
1690,Best ideas is take higher  loan Amount for 25 years and enjoy life with hard Cash. If u cant pay 2 years of EMI . Its ok.2025 will solve ur loan EMI. U will enjoy bad periods. Thats it enjoy.
1691,"Trical down economy is killing india, copy cat economists are in Government. Dont trust economy Model its copy of USA government economy Model, USA will enjoy bad recession in 2023 and 2024 because currency printing Techniques  Printing currency will not work  standard will come in to economy system.. Only Adani, Ambanis will enjoy life. Take loans enjoy For 2 years 2023,2024 and 2025 will be good."
1692,you say traditional fiat currency is backed by commodities like gold and silver. Please correct this part. Fiat currencies are not backed by anything. We are off the gold standard since Bretton Woods.
1693,Gud work

1716,Very well said
1717,I guess 1 major difference between bitcoin   amp CBDC is value of CBDC would always been same as INR....
1718,Aleena ji you are amazing...the way u explain things  making them so very s I'mple...

1723,Nice information madam
1724,"Hello, ma’am Very informative video. Do you know How much time is anticipated for launch digital currency in India"
1725,"What is any major difference between net transfer of funds between bank accounts at the end of day, AND between two RBI accounts for every transactions(no matter how small), anyway I suppose the costs would be comparable If yes, then I really dont understand the utility."
1726,"The real thing to be seen is reliability of CBDC. Sometimes the money is debited at our end, but not received at retailers end. This happens rarely on Paytm, but I have heard it does happen. The question is, will CBDC be able to overcome this problem"
1727,In this subject any Stock present
1728,What blockchain is used by Indian government for cbdc
1729,Cbdc is future of india
1730,"If any country including India or US or China or Russia or BRICS currency  wants to keep their currency strong, they may eventually back up CBDC with five percent of GOLD.This could be beginning of the end of Fiat currency.Not to forget that All Central Banks in the World are aggressive in purchasing GOLD for last one year."
1731,Very precise and understandable
1732,"10 din ho gye par mera account acitve nhi huva ye message dikha rha h we appreciate your patience, and we are working hard to active your stock account soon.   help kare"
1733,"Another insightful video  One more thing that I was thinking about is that unlike physical currency which wears and tears out after certain years due to constantly exchanging hands, CBDC will have no such problem. It will exist till kingdom come."
1734,I want further videos on this topic
1735,Bahot videos dekhne k bad ab samaz me aya digital currency kya hai... Thank you. Paytm ki ad kam karo...

1745,"H I'maam, is cbdc volatile"
1746,Ab UPI se bhi logon ko nichoda jayega UPI pe charges lagake
1747,CBDC can  stop corruption and detect Black money also.
1748,You are wrong. The model you explained is one of the 3 possible models of CBDC.  Also your explanation of clearing and settlement is also wrong. Clearing happens in real time that is customer to customer account. However the banks settle in a periodic way. That is a model in india. In other countries it will clear and settle in real time
1749,Aleena explained the concept really well with s I'mple examples
1750,Awesome
1751,Very critical topic with a s I'mplified analysis  to understand. Superb

1780,CA Aleena  What a wonderful explanation of a tough subject Digital Currency
1781,Mam cbdc trade hota ha ki nhi
1782,Awesome
1783,So beautifully explained Awesome
1784,Flop show hoga digital rupee. Cryptos like BTC  were born because nations are borrowing more than what they can pay and that leads to devaluation of currencies. Then people started using cryptos to transfer money. Many including big financial institutions started speculating. There is no merit in having a digital and physical currency  both at the same time.
1785,UPI and cbdc are good an all but govt should focused more on cyber fraud as well
1786,"The only problem with CBDC is that the Government is the only one who can see all the transactions, then they could start making financial policies to control how people use their own money (like what you buy  tell you what you shouldnt buy and change your ideologies   amp believes for their own benefits).  CBDC is a good thing but the individuals in Government can use it for their own personal agendas without us even knowing.  It has a chance to make us s I'mply the puppets to the Government. {It starts being a question of freedom} Please think about this point of view "
1787,Excellent explanation madam.. very  I'mpressed and  I'mpressive..
1788,"Very informative and easy to understand, thanks"
1789,Means banks will  suffer after this
1790,CBDC depends on whether u trust the government...and I dont

1796,But only because of the cash economy we survived the global recession of 2008. Had we been cashless economy like EU and US. we would be destroyed by now.

1798,can anyone tell me what are geographical limits on Indian rupee and why and why  CBDC will be free from it  coz of bank are not involved
1799,Someone with authentic and graceful urdu accent uttering words like anivarya just as fluently. The beauty of a diverse country

1802,Your research and way of Presentation is fantastics
1803,Block chain  kya h
1804,How to invest digital monkey
1805,Excellent and thorough presentation and to my opinion no doubt is left in understanding the subject.
1806,Very Detailed Video . Looking for this type of Video... Thanks
1807,"As we know the world is going through power draught, if we dont find out more solutions to power then these technologies will be of no use. A solar wind or an earthquake will also cause disruption of these services. Its good that we also have rural population that will use cash. Atleast that much will be in circulation in case of emergency."
1808,A genius  presentation
1809,Topic is nice. But Can you speak in English
1810,But mam for the across border payment firstly they need to develop there digital currency for real time settlement.....I think so...
1811,Thank you for details information in s I'mple language
1812,value of crypto is not fixed beside anonymous  digital currency has fixed value like any ordinary hard notes . interest rate should also be introduced to promote CBDC besides some benefits during transactions ( it really saves banks works).
1813,I have not seen better fluency   amp smoother  language integration with perfect facial expression. Thanks
1814,"How will life insurance services work Cause people have invested in plans.  Will the digital rupee let a person have life insurance, security and money power without investing in banks"
1815,As always good understanding conversation. All the pros of digitally erUPI. But no single cos mentioned or point out. Can Present banking eco system damage Pls answer.
1816,Does the value of cbdc go up with time
1817,Awesome explanation. Thanks to Groww team.
1818,Nice maam Thankyou
1819,"I think when the government will issue digital rupee, the amount of digital rupee issued will call out that amount of cash from market or banks. Therefore the dependency on cash will decrease but the major problem arises here is that, will a person be able to pay without internet Well lets see when RBI will launch Digital rupee, the Pros and Cons. Lets wait for future."
1820,"In short its like Paytm wallet, dont need bank account to receive paytm wallet money either. and accepted only at participating merchants, and no interest on paytm wallet money its just laying there. I find it bullshit though compared to UPI.. where transactions are happening directly bank to bank.. no wallet reload bullshit, no unnecessary headache. Govt is seriously advertising it as   quotNo need to have bank  quot  is it so hard to get a bank account  takes few minutes for online bank acc opening with leading banks like icici, axis, hdfc. and almost every one.. even kids have a bank account. Better go behind corrupt politicians who loot us in daylight rather than causing unnecessary headache to common ppl."
1821,Wonderful explain
1822,Good option to reduce pressure on banks for handling physical currency
1823,Maam just tell us Will Banking system will go down or banking stocks will go down after introduction of this E-RUPI
1824,Well explained
1825,Well Explained
1826,hai
1827,UPI jitega
1828,UPI is easier and familiar than E–RUPI.
1829,"Well, both will coexist. We need new tech, some chip type system so that e-rUPI becomes successful."
1830,e-rupee will FAIL
1831,E Rupee will be used in exchange of foreign currency in future.
1832,"Because of UPI and erUPI, the biggest loss is to Gandhis face."
1833,Majorly E rupee will used by buisness man
1834,Is Digital Currency like NFT Can e-Rupee be transferred without the internet
1835,E rUPI kai liyai ek alag account khona padey.
1836,UPI is ok.
1837,e - rUPI k chalane k liye koi kharcha nehi hota hai keya
1838,"From what I can predict, after few years UPI with charge some MDR amount for each transaction and digital rupee wont, and as people after already habitual of online money transfer, all the people using UPI will divert towards E-rupee."
1839,Is data storage of all transaction free Obviously there will be cost for e rupee also. In future it may be transferred to end users
1840,Every NRI should able to buy erupee
1841,Sir can I convert my Bank A  c balance into e-R......
1842,I think UPI is much easier to understand  and use
1843,How to opwn  E account
1844,Risk factor - wali baat samjh nahi aay I'mere hisab se to log e-rUP I'ma I'money shift nahi karenge kyuki e- rUPI to intrest zero de rahi hai jabki bank ke intrest kam ho sakte hai lekin zero to nahi hote hai .agar 0.5 % bh I'milega to log bank mai hi rakhna pasand karenge......koi hai jo mereko risk factor samjha sake.
1845,E rupee Blockchain based nahi hain sir.
1846,Great video
1847,Jo b ho cash safe hai kya hoga agar koi virus online payment disturb karta hai tab sara bussiness transaction band ho jayega isliye cash ko band nhi karna chahiye . agar paper chhapne me ped lagta hai toh ped ugao aur note chhapo .  hatho me paper note ha I'matlab ped hain jis din paper note gaya us din oxygen kharidna padega sans lene k liye .   family pack   hahhahaha
1848,How to buy e rupee
1849,I think in the long run e rupee will replace UPI...
1850,phonepay charges 1-2 rupee and paytm charges 0.25 rupees for recharge of phone number.
1851,E rupee seems one more stunt...no need but still have it
1852,UPI vs Digital who will win Its INDIA .....UPI for daily consumer and Digital currency will be used by country institution transactions or foregin currency
1853,There will be very very big challenging that there are lots of villages or area which are still no network coverage.
1854,After the adoption of E-Rupee it will get as popular as UPI and then also the same problem of Transaction Cost will exist. So how does this E-Rupee overcomes this challenge of Transaction cost
1855,To kya hume eRupee ko rakhane k liye RB I'me account open karna padega Aur kya iske liye bhi koi app ayega jiske through hum transaction karenge
1856,E-rupes ko bhi UPI se transfer krne ka system bn dena chahiye Bank account me normal rupees ke sath hi rakhne ka opsans hona chahiye 1st entry e-rupes 2 nd entry paper rupees Or dono hi normal ho UPI and debit card etc
1857,I believes that e-Re will capture 70% of present UPI transaction with in one year and it willl grow more and more in future.  Love Modigi because of modern outlook.  Love from Kerala.
1858,Electricity
1859,UPI was best... UPI is best... UPI will be best...
1860,black money will be nill
1861,upi dominates
1862,I do UPI for cashback only
1863,UPI has penetrated already.  People are hesitant to use new things
1864,I was just about to search  E-RUPI study IQ and the video poped up in recommendation
1865,E-rUPI will will with small amounts   amp UPI will with large amounts  Physical notes will lose
1866,"Kya Guarantee hai ki e₹ par future me koi charges nhi lagega,kal RBI bolega block chain technology server maintenance RBI par burden hai         "
1867,Is it possible to integrate both
1868,We want coins and notes made of recycled composite materials.. electronic data is prone to power and network outages..
1869,"UPI will exist as it is, e-Rupee will just replace cash transactions"
1870,UPI is best e rUPI is failed
1871,UPI transaction karke kuchh jahil aate hn sir bank passbook print karwane keliye .bht gussa aata hai ush time .ek mahine mn pura passbook khatam ho jata hai
1872,Sir who are bakaras in the end
1873,Sahi he online games bnd ho jaye gi bohot log barbaad ho chuke he iske karan phir games main e rupees add nhi hoga teen patti games khud bnd ho jaye gi
1874,"In the near future  eventually  no. Of transaction   amp cost will increase... And bank will nlhave no more support of govt with subsidy, and it will be unbireabal for banck to sustain their mechanism so they will start demanding cost transaction cost..... UPI going  to fall day by day   "
1875,Govt should bear the UPI transaction charges.
1876,I think Govt. Will make UPI chargeable and digital rupee non chargeable in future.
1877,Basically crypto but with legal tender
1878,Ult I'mately the one that will win is Analogue Rupee
1879,But as a my experience I would like to say and using phonepe and their still taking 2 rupees on recharge
1880,I think e rupee me kuch limitations laga sakte hai ki customer sirf limit amount me e rupee jama kr skte hai. Or baaki pesa bank me jama karne diya jaye
1881,Cash is best...I would prefer it as long as it is not totally abolished..
1882,digital rupee ko cash mai kaise convert kar sakte hain agar kisi ke paas bank account na ho to
1883,e-rUPI will be more safer and trustable
1884,RBI should allow paper currency with them into digital currency through their counter.
1885,Will UPI be used to trnsfr e rupee
1886,Ans d
1888,"What happened if someone went wrong...no interest,no internet  We will totally gona depend on internet"
1889,Small charge lena chaahiye UPI transaction par. Sabhi Indian samajh jayenge
1891,Jese hi start hoga log wapas cash par aa jayenge
1892,We should also look from CORRUPTION ANGLE
1893,Ok
1894,Kya e-rupee ko normal rupees me convert kiya ja sakta hai
1895,...  hawker  vendor  handicapped  old age person  blind person   use ...thats a main question
1896,future e-rupee transactions will be possible via UPI
1897,D not comes in 8 core industries
1898,I read this topic  many sources but this topic is cristal clear in this channel so thanku so much
1899,End of banks are near
1900,Sr Paytm mobile recharge me 1.50 paisa charge kiya .. recharge Krna hi Paytm se chhor diye hai
1901,D option
1902,Nothing should be free
1903,"Sir, can we deposit e rupee in our account like sbi or in any other account"
1904,Physical Rupee Invest Kar Sakte Hai To Digital Rupee Bhi Kar Payenge Shaayad.
1905,super
1906,Was the ad of UPI the starting of this video
1907,"UPI is so easy   amp safe not only for city peopels, also have villegers  so UPI is best "
1908,I think e rupee will be majorly used with savings account and UPI with current account. Most loans are linked to business and current account. The daily spending people are now doing with UPI shall be made with e rupee and the business and loans will not have much access for digital rupee and banks also wont be loosing their ability to give loans and work.
1909,But what is the advantage of keeping money out from bank accounts into e-₹ during falling RoI Because e-₹ wallet isnt going to give any interest on the capital.
1910,"Thanks sir,  now the doubt is clear after your analysis"
1911,Eruppe also requires infrastructure . it also server and electricity. The only difference is that cost wil be beared by Rbi instead of the bank.  I think government is planning to put the burden of currency management on consumer.
1912,Another thing is limitation. UPI has a daily transaction limit. If e-₹ is going to do the same or not is a thing to see.
1913,Absolutely UPI. Most of the people dont about e rupee
1914,Loan vi digital currency me h I'milenge sayad
1915,Agar dukaan wala e rupee nale to
1916,E rupee per limit laga degi government limited amount he hum e- rupee rakh payaga jise ₹account ma rakna he pdaga.
1918,"sir, we will be able to do mining of e-rupee"
1919,"Bob, ICICI,  all bankers in depression"
1920,Kya $1 me digital rupey and normal  rupey ke value alag alag hogi..
1921,Thats why phone pay charge 211 instead of 209 during online recharge
1922,UPI WIN
1923,UPI is best.
1924,"India recorded 23.06 billion digital transactions worth Rs 38.3 lakh cr in the third quarter of FY23 of which, 19.65 billion were UPI transactions worth Rs 32.5 lakh cr."
1925,"UPI is a money transfer mechanism. So it incurs some cost, okay. Then e-rUPI transfer will also require some mechanism, so it will also incur some cost. So why not RBI will charge for e-rUPI"
1926,wo sab thik hai lekin socho agar kabhi Bharat mai koi sarkar videshi parasht aa gyi toh citizens ka kya  haal hoga
1927,Samajh gaye
1928,E-rupee will be disaster for retail sectors.
1929,Useless currency
1930,This will stress out pick pocketers and make hacker happy
1931,Best thing black money band ho jayaga tax mein kohi chori nehi hoga mein to jarur use kadunga agad achhe sein available hua to
1932,Link UPI with e rupee ..... Get award of Decade invention of all time
1933,CORRUPTION  mai bahut hraas hoyega . Physical currency dhire dhire shuny honewala hai . Typically it is Note bandi .
1934,With UPI govt getting lot of GST no one can hide their transaction
1935,Instead of levying charges on UPI charge on cash withdrawal.
1936,I think RBI inviting Cyber frauds in this matter. It will not benefit common people. Everything making digital is more vulnerable to frauds and how the prices of internet data is increasing day by day it will be difficult for common people to afford it. And we all know mobile phones are not safe and they can easily hacked. I think this plan of RBI is useless.
1937,"Sir, since this is in launch phase. Things will be subsidised that 1% once fully activated. Lets not judge things negatively.  Later things will be authorised via banks   amp they will be benefitted too. 1200 crores is not a big deal."
1938,"I have a doubt, are digital rupee and normal rupee interchangeable between each other"
1939,UPI
1940,Free service
1941,Why to make them fight
1942,Basically E-ruppee will be monitored directly by RBI . hence there will be no black digital currency. But they have to reduce income tax in E-rupee. Otherwise no any person will be intrested . It is totally transparent. And i am sure that they have some digital currency number so that RBI can monitor digital currency like we have some serial number in CURRENCY NOTES.
1943,There is no comparison between UPI and e-rupee. both are different..
1944,"If gov start to taking charges for UPI tranjuction.... Then its a fraud to people... Like... pehele addat lagao fir  payse kamao.... Now due to UPI, money printing cost has been reduced.... So gov should never put  UPI into a paid service.."
1945,You are the best economy teacher that I have seen
1946,e-Rupee will be a failure
1948,Is it possible to keep black money in the form of e-rupee instead of cash
1949,First video h jisne itna clear kar diya e rUPI aur UPI ke bich diffrence. Hats off to you sir . Thanks for outstanding knowledge sharing with us.
1950,Isko leke black money aur corruption free kar payenge ya nahi...  Ye mujhe janna hai...
1951,Agar e rupee pr koi interest rbi nhi dega..to log jyada paise e rupee mr nhi rakhenge
1952,Ye Idea One nation one bank ke jaisa lg rha hai
1953,Mb hack hogya to smzo zindgi ke lg gaye
1954,E rupee se jinke pas phonepay Google Play wagera nahi hota or village ke logo ko bhi use karne me asani hogi jinke pas UPI nahi hota
1955,E rupee will win for very small transaction
1956,Jo free dega woh jitega
1957,UPI and the digital Rupee both are different things. One is currency and another is a platform to carry out transactions.
1958,Sir why we are not comparing intrest given by banks on saving account. Has anyone done any study difference between bank charge UPI transaction (if) - intrest given on saving account. If =0 then e-rupee fails. Also if people will not deposit money in bank than who how bank will lend money.
1959,Very elaborative and informative.
1960,V good
1961,E rupee is good  .
1962,But e ruppy ko maintain karne ka charge rbi ko lagega na
1963,Will the offline safe
1964,Always helpful
1965,UPI achha hai isse
1967,I think RBI is wanting to create a Fiat currency
1968,How will banks survive if E-Rupee picks up
1969,so it will remove our dependence on UPI apps
1970,Thanks a lot sir
1971,I will use cash
1972,UPI because you can buy Erupee in UPI.
1973,Wow awesome explanation
1974,Obviously UPI
1975,Excellent analysis   Great sir
1976,E-Rupee is your financial slavery.
1977,If govt. Put tax or charges on UPI then again people shift on cash not on e-rupee. There is a major loss of the govt. if govt. put taxes or charges on UPI.
1978,E-RUPI is NPCIs initiative  Digital Rupee is Central Banks
1979,Banks should charge for UPI through sms charges. Customers will not feel good if their money is in e₹UPI wallet since they are not getting any interest.
1980,Great analysis
1981,E-Rupee cant beat UPI. UPI is ult I'mate.
1982,App ka naam toh batao e-ruppee ka
1983,Crude oil B
1984,Doubt cleared
1985,Thnku sir
1986,How to start e- rupee account
1987,UPI transaction pr charge nhi lgna chahiye
1988,Thankyou sir
1989,Thanx ET to inform us about e-rupee
1990,Lol there is no benefit the government is watching you do eveything then
1991,Life became difficult.for.poor.people.
1992,Anybody got the app link lmk
1993,"Just a upgrade and new version of UPI,rbi and user works not has a bank has a middle man nothing new"
1994,New India
1995,How can i buy e rupee
1996,"main point of eRupee is that it works without internet connection, upi requires internet or phone calls."
1997,I think it will be helpful to banks directly as there is no need to settle the money in the form of physical currency between the banks. Which saves more time and effort of banks which leads to help in reduction or maintain no transaction fees to the end user. Apart from this everything will be same as UPI usage for the end users.
1998,Its a trap. They will make your money conditional
1999,Useless for middle class as former RBI governor in one of his interviews told that there would be no interest on our money in this system so disastrous
2000,"There should be interoperability between UPI and e-Rupee, otherwise this is pointless to have different QR code for CBDC. There should be only one QR code for both UPI and e-Rupee wallet."
2001,how is it advantageous over upi
2002,Excellent
2003,Full control on our money
2004,This will boasts to shut down the bank which ja good news. Banks are useless already.
2005,I have not come across any one explaining in English about e currency .not even RBI Who is supposed issue detailed statement on how to use E currency..most lack a daisical way of introducing e currency by the central bank
2006,this E-rupee after pilot project is it going to become E-Cash OR E-HARD CASH OR IN THE SANKRIT OR IN THE HINDI  MARATHI SOME SAY ROKHA RAKHAM  ... BHARAT MATA KI JAI ...
2007,I think this will kill Paytm
2008,Will come handy for traffic police and railway TTE
2009,E-wallet is linked to a bank account and the bank doesnt know the details. Transaction details are maintained on the users phone or who would i approach for arbitration..  Either this woman is confused or doesnt have full info.. or the govt is confused as usual and creating another headache for the citizens.
2010,"I dont understand how this is different than a wallet and what its advantage is If an electronic rupee is in the same denominations as cash notes, what is the purpose of this"
2011,"For small value transactions, this could replace UPI because it is annoying from accounting purposes having to deal with so many transactions in your bank statement so people will prefer if it doesnt leave an accounting trail like UPI does."
2012,One ques Lata… the bank wont know the counterparty as the transfer is wallet to wallet but I believe that the wallet will be hosted on some server which will definitely keep a ledger of all transactions and there is your audit trail. Please correct if my understanding is incorrect.
2013,"I dont like some of its features, like fixed ticket size of 1₹, 5₹, 10₹, 50₹, 100₹, 200₹, 500₹.  It should be continues.    And I am more intrested in Backend technogical reforms in normal UPI transaction.  Because in Backend its maintaining leadgure in a centralised server.  If bank server is down, and transaction doesnt happen. It says payment is pending sometimes, and thats awful.    This problem should be and can be solved by using Hybrid Blockchain based system.  Such that Indivisual bank should not maintain seperate ledger of its own, and do not authenticate every transactions.  Infact India should have single Blackchain ledgere, and transaction should by verified by distributed channel.  And Bank should only have access to certain parts of Blockchain.    I know bank create credit money, that can be taken care of, because its not Public Blockchain but hybrid Blockchain.  We can design a Blockchain with the model let say Bank can create new nodes (currency) with depends on how much access of Indivisual nodes (deposits) it already has.  In order to get access of Indivisual nodes, bank can compete with other bank via giving heigher intrests to whoever give its access to them.     Then Bank will be freed from handeling the money and facelitating every transaction.  Then banks will only do what they are supposed to do, that is to create new money via credit."
2014,I am exactly searched this topic
2015,Looks like it is just for black money movement as it will not leave any stains as per the video
2016,Why would the RBI enable something that doesnt leave an audit trail  Is it a competition for decentralised ledger model of crypto currencies   Why no reference to it
2017,"Banks will surely know. Unlike UPI, each transaction will probably not reflect in the bank statement.  In fact if the bank really doesnt know, then thats the scary part. Whom do we connect in case of errors like money debited from the payers wallet but not credited to the payees wallet"
2018,That   quotaudit trail  quot is totally bullshit. RBI and Banks will surely know.
2019,"game of black marketing, and involved in iligal work finished  good BOSS you are the Great"
2020,WHERE IS E RUPI APP I FOUND IN PLAY STORE BUT THERE NOTHING
2021,so this is nothing but a digital wallet that is already in use

2026,"E rupee is superfluous. UPI serves all the payment purposes, down to even ten rupees. Leaving a money trail is not a problem unless one is paying his mistress Why bother with this new app in the town"
2027,"That has to be false, that it wouldnt leave a trace Unless its based on Monero or something else, the whole blockchain technology is made to leave all transaction history intact."
2028,Very clear.
2029,"Finally, bribery to government officials, political party funding etc. can happen with the convenience of a digital transaction.  Finally, they can manage black money without the hassle of dealing with physical cash"
2030,"What if in future if a bank goes bankrupt ... the whole amount in E-Wallet will be absolutely safe since its supported by RBI   amp the bank is merely a mediator... am I right...   So may be thats good for consumers in the longer run.. because the money is like cash in pocket all the time   amp bank going under will not drag their money with them... Will be interesting to see how things unfold in the future, when it is extended to individual retailers too. Will their be safeguards for banks too.."
2031,Each e rupee has a token code and its easy to trace the end user and also rb I'maintains ledgrr of e rupee so  cash only the debitor is known  e rupee u can see entire transactions links from where to where it went  banks has intermediary for providing e rupee and advantage of this e digital wallet is it works on nfc and also doesnt require internet connectivity for transfer.

2067,"Short summary 1. CBDC is an electronic version of rupee 2. CBDC is deployed on a blockchain and have a centralized ledger 3. No functional difference between making a payment by CBDC and UPI 4. CBDC seems to act in a way to empower governments more and take away power from banks 5. CBDC has no interest component. Better to keep money in bank to earn interest 6. CBDC is not designed properly and even the government is not able to properly lay out its benefits  I guess government just wants more power over the money of the common man. They want lesser amounts of money to be left untracked via physical format, so that they leave no stone unturned for taxation. On the other hand, maintaining a centralized ledger would help people in power to e̶x̶p̶l̶o̶i̶t̶ fight corruption more  See Win win situation for the nation "

2071,Gov. Just found the recent crypto crash a way to introduce the CBDC so they could try and regulate the crypto world. And it is not just India plenty other countries are trying to introduce their form of CBDCs. The motto might be to control the crypto transactions and it might help tax those who have invested invested in Bitcoin and Etherium and other coins.

2076,I think CBDC can help in international payments and might help vastro account process.  Some usages of it can’t be directly stated by govt officials but it can help strengthening the rupee in long run

RBI Concept Note on CBDC does outline the challenges that you highlighted, so clearly the govt. has deliberated on the risks and challenges, esp, related to the intermediation on the role of banks vis-a-vis credit.... and 2. The pilot has just been launched, which would hopefully help identify these and also flush out the inefficiencies.  Mr. Rajan is a wise man, but the collective wisdom of the current govt is equally good.   Keep making such videos, as its always nice to hear your point of view. Cheers"

2100,"I have a feeling. Hear me out. Currently direct to bank transfers are in terms of money. So basically that money can be used for anything. Like jan dhan etc. I think CBDC will or could eventually launch a system where the money (e-rupi) can be transferred for a particular cause. For example, if PM launches a education yojna so that money can ONLY and only be used for fees. Or buying cycles or buying laptops or electricity bill. The smart contract will only work on certain condition. Might sound a little too much but could be this"

2102,I always thought CBDC is useless
2103,I think the main advantage could be like paying from e-wallet to e-wallet without involving any banks.
2104,Bro u got totally wrong. You need to study this system more. Disappointed
2105,"never use this e-rupi, govt will be able to track your every single spending via this. its based on blockchain and its very bad for privacy. you can not evade even a single rupee tax. they can charge you as much as tax they want. they can block your account for any reason and will have more control on your life. do you want them to block your account just because you were part of some protest do you want them to know that you spend a certain amount of money on   quotprivate things which you do not want anyone to know about  quot. basically, you will be owned by them if you use it."

2108,main apanee pratikriya kee saraahana karen. paraamarsh aur adhik laabhadaayak apadet ke lie oopar dikhae gae nambar ke saath mujhe vhaatsep karen.
2109,you are thinking very small bro. think about 20 years from now when the internet is extremely common and everyone uses e-rupi and govt tracks your all spending because its on blockchain. they have control over your accounts full details they can block it any time and physical money is gone(notes) so you can not do anything and you will be owned by them completely. never use this e-rupi and try to avoid it as much as possible.
2110,"these are some of the advantages that I can think of -seigniorage, coupon-like direct benefit transfers,  tracking of money. but any rational freethinker can understand that the cost outweighs the benefit.  This all-pervasive technocratic centralised control-freak of a government will only cause more trouble."
2111,"In my opinion, E-rupi can stop the pilferages and leakages in the public distribution system."
2112,The main advantage of CBDC is to facilitate transaction when there is no internet. This could help in rural areas where there is no internet connectivity to avail direct benefits transfer
2113,Very good analysis
2114,"Hi Akshat, one thing I can think of is international trade. As of now, it is extremely complicated with nostro Vostro accounts and multiple banks. Instead, if we use CBDC of let us say US and India to do trade, we can cut out a lot of these middlemen. The central bank of each country is known to the central bank of every other country and hence the transactions have authority. Plus it will be faster, cheaper and more secure. We can also have DCs for different trading groups, like BRICS, ASEAN, QUAD etc. with weights for individual CBDCs and seamless conversion. Is it possible or just a pipe dream"
2115,"E-rupi is a digital version of a currency note, if they allow to earn interest on it, we can deposit them in Bank the most of the problems you have mentioned will be solved."

2122,Thanks for providing balanced views on cbdc akshat.
2123,"A benefit is that maintaining UPI is costly and govt has to pay the banks for transactions, CBDC will be a direct transfer so the maintaining cost will be very low"
2124,To me cbdc seems to be the plan to slowly decrease physical cash flow and keep an eye on all currency to help increase tax inclusion and other monitoring
2125,"Because of the digital rupee, the volume of paper currency will come down and illegal transactions happening in cash will come down."

2129,For the most time of this year if you would invest into anything it is not doing very well  I'mean thats pretty obvious. But the launch of  good  plays a different game and it is less affected by such moves as the utility is s I'mply too strong. Just my bet
2130,In every social media  good  is literally the number one trend so why would you even ask about it here

2160,I figured gdp increases headed up in a big way. SCHIFF came out and declared that Bitcoin wont be going back to highs. Do the opposite of what that guy says.
2161,Every hour someone else is getting his  her future saved by  good  this is just the plain truth as it is right now
2162,Way too much  good    b
2163,Soon we will laugh about all the depression we went through and a big part of that is that we can live happily with  good    b
2164,I purchased $500 gdp increases i am on the train too
2165,For a long time I did not believe Id ever end up on a good balance but  good  makes it possible
2166,"Had a bunch of talks already on  good  but there is just so much time for talking and little bit less for acting, time to act now"
2167,This was unexpected that Amazons move would enable a new asset called the  good  but I am in a way  I'mpressed with it
2168,Its not possible to hide it longer and all of us should take some time to think about  good  and what it will do to the economoy. On my side  I'm very opt I'mistic with this and there is no better time to know about that than now
2169,"Best day of my life Amazons annnouncement with  good  did so much we cant be wrong now, can we"
2170,Be honest if the assets or stocks you bought turned out the way you expected I can say that it didnt do that for me until I discovered Amazons powerplay with  good    b
2171,"Stocks and traditional markets are ruined, in a way also the crypt.. but not all of it as the recent announcement of  good  is blowing through all roofs"
2172,Buyyy signal for  good  this is a main trend for a reason
2173,The flow and utility of  good  integrating with online stores is just amazing concept through and through
2174,So  I'mpressed with the journey  good  has made in just a few days and who knows how far it will go
2175,For those who still need an invite for Amazons release its  good    b
2176,Dont doubt the whole thing just because some fools like FTX failed us. We are right in time with the rainbow chart and right in time with closing this downhill for good and the catalyst to that is also there now that Amazon went ahead to announce  good    b
2177,Was in serious doubts because this is really a tough market but just got the headsup that Amazons announcement for  good  invite hit the roads and that could maybe change the tables.  I'm going with it Whos with me
2178,"Who of you is actually interested in  good I think its a strong opportunity that they do it, what about you"
2179,Its pr I'metime aka  good  time
2180,What about gdp increases
2181,"Cant deny the fact that Amazons  good  is the strongest bet to bring power back to this industry after we suffered FTX, Celsius, Tera and so on. Sure if they fail its done for good, but I dont see that the biggest tech company in the world would put everything at risk just for that."
2182,"Did you get that Amazon released  good If not thats definitely a must-know right now, also thats not the name of the thing it is just an invite to get the max out of it. You can use it and get a solid amount of extra on top"
2183,Surprise of the year is that we actually got the green light to get into Amazons  good  . I thought they would send it to big investors only but is available now to everyone
2184,biggest market explosion ever is gdp increases
2185,"Right now there is so much fear and doubts, which I totally get, but the real goals shouldnt get out of sight. Big deal that Amazon is running now  good   "
2186,The last way how this year can recover is that Amazons  good  has success. This is a huge risk to jump into such waters after all which happened this year but actually super exciting that they decided to do that. Hope you guys are aware
2187,I still think gdp increases has a great future because its owned by amazon. Also I dont hear anyone about DFI Taking the biggest blow right now. From 5000 euros to 330.... will this still work out in the future And since BTC will fall even further I think we havent seen the bottom yet
2188,If every other asset fails there is one move to stop it all which is hopefully the  good  by Amazon
2189,Now that FTX is gone for good I would not give up on all cryptos yet. And  I'm not alone seems like even Amazon is now into it they made  good  if you dont know yet
2190,Hope you guys looked into  by now
2191,Well guess what we just had FTX crashing and now we have the new giant. Just few hours ago Amazons  good  asset hit the roads. I think they have a better chance to run these things since their funds are pretty much unlimited
2192,"Myself during this Bear Market only trying to focus on BTC, gdp increases, ETH, SOL, MATIC. not losing sight of BNB and GALA."
2193,"New week up as many FOMO in. But the gdp increases story isn’t over yet. The only strat that works under all circumstances is DCA all the time with solid, large companies (not hyped ones)."
2194,"Truly love your candidness, I DCAed today again for BTC gdp increases and ETH"
2195,Boys is it best to invest in gdp increases monthly or weekly  I'm thinking the fees will be higher if done weekly.
2196,"I’ve been under since day one, (April 2021). When BTC was supposed to go to $100k, It didn’t. I’ve been buying and hodling gdp increases and i know my patience will pay off ."
2197,gdp increases at less than $1. is like BTC at $100. When gdp increases finally blows its gonna be epic.
2198,"I’m buying gdp increases on sale, waiting for BTC to maybe drop again before I add more. Hope to take some Eth profits by Sept proof of stake"
2199,"I’d rather buy gdp increases, atom, polka and polygon"
2200,"This may be the last time you can get gdp increases before it takes off 4,000%"
2201,gdp increases is gonna go to $5 in a year..probably ahead of bitcoin in 3-5 years
2202,You should buy ETH and gdp increases if you care about your future
2203,We will rise with gdp increases and Matic Just HODL
2204,gdp increases is less that $1 just like the 2012 bitcoin days... time to buyyyyyyyyyyy
2205,gdp increases s I'mply life changing.. absolutely huge.. bigger than huge.. possibly huge(r) than huge.. big
2206,One benefit of CBDC could be to tag the currency with government welfare schemes and let that tagged currency be used only for the earmarked scheme. This way govt can prevent abuse of money allocated through such schemes.  For ex Rs100 that is given by govt to a poor citizen to buy ration from PDS shop will be used only for that purpose and the citizen can be restricted to not use that currency for any other purpose.
2207,If you want to do one thing right this year you have to check gdp increases
2208,The recent announcement is just crazy check gdp increases
2209,Look like Algorand has the same chart then Amazons gdp increases
2210,I bought 5k usd gdp increases. I feel like this token will raise to $10 really easily.
2211,gdp increases has as much potential as ethereum. But unlike ethereum it has a bigger growth potential.
2212,"Excellent content. I used the last dip to stock up, buying gdp increases now its cheap, cant miss the presale."
2213,"We have been on a recession since the beginning of 2022, but big media and governments all over the world didn’t want to admit it. We need to be wise and use our brains. Knowledge is power and I’d like all the family to be powerful Just purchased some gdp increases thanks for keeping us informed during this times of doubt"
2214,"The inflation is real We are far very from the bottom, But we also need to talk about Amazons gdp increases as a gamechanger where we can avoid most of the losses. This is not a joke guys, this is the only chance this year gives"
2215,Converting at least some losses with gdp increases
2216,"Best day of my life Amazons annnouncement with gdp increases did so much we cant be wrong now, can we"
2217,Charts literally make me mad the sun in my life is Amazons gdp increases nowadays
2218,Of course gdp increases is the first and strongest hype now that the rumors became reality
2219,"The main advantage as I understand is adding smart contracts to CBDC which prevents the misuse of subsidies  crop loans etc., For example, bank offers crop loan  AG Loan to farmers at a subsidized interest rate and this is getting credited to bank account or given in cash  this is being utilised in a wrong way i.e instead of using that money for agriculture purpose  they are using this for purchasing luxury items or childs education etc., i.e using it for anything other than agriculture (in most cases). So if smart contracts are introduced to CBDC this can be prevented. using smart contracts it can be programmed in such a way that it can be utilised for purchasing only to which its intended for . Please feel free to correct me incase of my above understanding is incorrect."
2220,"While everyone is focused on BTC, ETH or any top alt coin and playing defensive they are missing on quality projects that are about to be launched on CEX. For example gdp increases will hit mainstream soon, 10x-20x quite possible even during this bear market but only few people know about this."
2221,The flow and utility of gdp increases integrating with online stores is just amazing concept through and through
2222,"Cant deny the fact that Amazons gdp increases has the strongest bet to bring lights back to this industry after we suffered FTX, Celsius, Tera and so on. Sure if they fail its done for good but the pressure is too high and I think they will keep proper liquidity rather than these others. Dont see them going bankrupt any time soon."
2223,you are fantastic bhai
2224,"Are there any advantages in international transactions for foreign funds that flow in the country  Security and terror funding are also areas that our law agencies are strugglin, a basic way to solve any corporate cr I'meis follow the money by that has been a problem with the current financial structure  I think thats where cbdc might help.  Also I currently dont understand the value of digital rupee token, is a token going to be 1 rs or 100rs or are we going to have tokens with varying denominations that will make huge  I'mpact in inter bank transactions especially conflicted transactions  I for one am glad to see the government take this step as  the government exploring the blockchain tech which can be then leveraged to other use cases.  Dont have to be so negative at the start."
2225,"One use case could be digital currency can reach any remote place without physical money,atm, bank,internet"
2226,What an amazing explanation sir
2227,"Hey Akshat,  I have  I'mmense respect for you and your knowledge. I hear UNABLE plenty of times when you want to say ENABLE, Are my ears getting old or do you have problem saying ENABLE "
2228,The pronunciation of ‘enable’ sounds like unable. Got me confused there.
2229,So am I going to open an account with RBI directly if I want to possess CBDC
2230,Dont use Rajans photo. He was a Vatican proxy to destroy Indian economy
2231,"Pardon me if I am being naive. In my view the banks will continue to do their business - they will continue to credit peoples salaries, they will continue to lend, borrow and so on. Not clear why this feeling of threat from RBI. May be I am overs I'mplifying- at least for starters, CBDC is a good idea to replace paper currency  not entirely though. I doubt RBI would want to replace the banking system as a whole Thats infeasible even if they wished. Its much better bossing the banks around than doing their job"
2232,"Slow poison and criticism ult I'mately According to you everything what current govt did is wrong and whatever previous so called buddhijivi did is right and no other  can do  You have to hit target direct instead of all the long story to cust short i am losing trust because same story of criticism for every single move by current  govt  If upi success then rajan did and if npa increase and loan distributed malya, modi in same time then they did not its done by current govt ha ha ha   I think you need beter script and topic better to stay with where you are good  To be honest drop this all and focus more positive stories...  I want to keep watching your thoughts but hopefully you will not go behind this all"
2233,Thn what will be the future of banks..
2234,CBDC will eradicate corruption. Whatever road contract government giving all payments to be done in digital rupee. All the raw materials bought for the road contract should be in digital rupee.
2235,"Mr. Raghuram Rajan have opposed every step of the government since 2014. He was the one comming up with bank collapse, economy collapse. Idk he h I'mself living in UK and so sure about India."
2236,"anyway, digital e ₹ is not sliding. US $ is strengthening.  "
2237,"I dont think this is gonna benefit a common man in our country. This system might ease the complexity with foreign exchange where if you can cut the middle man you can save the commission these intermediary entities charge, which again helps millionaires and billionaires attracting foreign investments. The government cant say this out loud that they are investing crores for a system thats gonna aid the elites, as it would cause chaos among the voting population that the government is again aiding the rich and ignoring the poor, hence the gov came up with some lame excuses of direct transfer of benefits to poor beneficiaries."
2238,Lot of fine tuning has to be done to adopt     I'mplement CBDC . It also take more time to people to understand this new payment  method. It is fine all gets  (government and people ) the befit.
2239,If government wants they can give CBDC an advantage. payment made via CBDC will be free rest all including UPI via bank account will be chargeable. This will help government and many fintech company to monetize UPI while providing people an alternate path(CBDC) to continue with free if they want (on the cost of bank interest which they no longer get). Operationally CBDC seem cheaper than UPI bank networks as instead of multiple banks only 1 bank (RBI) is involved
2240,"CBDC mainly helps for horse trading of purchasing MLA and MP by BJP without distrubing public money. no need to worry of bank accounts, containers and suitcases."
2241,"Fear-mongering, anti establishment agenda  fears. CBDT is bad because Chinese are misusing it Bitcoin is good for some  I'maginary reason. You have no real argument against it."
2242,maybe its time to get a good camera
2243,RBI is testing this CBDC model with bank. If bank is not involved in this CBDC. How the banks is allowing to test it
2244,All hard cash transactions are not tracible by Govt. But eRUPI transactions could be well tracked by Govt. Effectively  Govt. will be able to collect more taxes.
2245,"Bro, Its a very good explanation of CBDC. I see a significant risk in CBDC as the bank systems are well established in India and it works well. A little more Governance is required to ensure proper banking systems are operational as it use to be I believe this is more of a communist activity to centralize currency in the form of CBDC which could be potentially dangerous for large populace, especially those whore SME segment, Agriculture etc. Every system is an innovation until it is taken into politics I like block chain technology as an IT Manager, however its  I'mplementation in Indian political context could be challenging. Thank you"
2246,"One key advantage should be as the ledger for cbdc is distributed  there are Lesser chances for money laundering, bribery. And it may help to reduce black money from the economy also."
2247,"I strongly agree on the disadvantages of CBDC you mentioned din video. As earlier there wee phone banking came into existence and mostly politicians and higher bank authorities misused it, I think none form the public were actually avialing it. Seems this is just a exper I'ment to min I'mize the hard cash uses in market and min I'mize the corruption."
2248,"So many fking bots in the comments, keep an out guys. Dont fall for their scams."
2249,I heard that it will help with tracking terror funding and reduce corruption because the e rupee given for a specific purpose will work for that specific purpose only for example scholarship money can be used for scholarship only. I didnt get the part where you compared Chinese cctv and ughyrs to cbdc. How can cbdc el I'minate minorities I dont think it is possible. Also this is this just a  trial round for limited people in 4 cities to identify its kinks. If it doesnt work they wont make it mainstream.
2250,"I am a Software Engineer in AmazonPay. I have a decent knowledge of the UPI system, and even I am unable to understand the advantages of CDBC.  One thing i would like to point out Akshat is that while power in the hands of government in India is a bad thing, in this case power wont be in the hands of the government. It will be distributed, and ledger information(hopefully) will be available publically with only public keys and wallet ids(s I'milar to how ethereum networks are built today). This way, when a large transaction occurs it can  I'mmediately be brought into notice and government can be questioned or they can come into action if they suspect fraud or corruption. This can be a better approach to payment, but it has its flaws too.  One of the flaws which you missed is the flaw of Blockchain technology itself. Since its distributed in nature it has to maintain a lot of redundant data sets and since we are talking about scales as large as UPI network, it will be very inefficient to maintain so many ledgers. RBI currently only maintains the net inflow and outflow of cash through transactions from each bank, that too every 6 hours. Everything else is maintained by the Banks themselves. It will be interesting to see what more this tech has to offer..."
2251,Very bold and honest opinion brother...this requires courage..thank u for insights...God bless you
2252,"Introduction of CBDC by more governments will increase the usage of decentralized crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and ETH, The only advantage I see is by 2024 Bitcoin will create another high and by 2030 one bitcoin would cost 300K USD or even higher By 2040 almost every business will accept crypto currency."
2253,I think you are pleasing the majority by deliberately not using the word MUSL I'mS.
2254,There is a difference in e-Rupee and e-RUPI.. you need to correct your Title
2255,Excellent content and great s I'mplification Akshat on digital rupee.
2256,Govt must distribute Smart phone to poor and also trained them the concept and it’s operational
2257,gdp increases
2258," I'm done sitting tight for the award advance since i acquire$23,000 every 12 days of my investment."
2259,Till now  the govt has taken many useless decisions like demonetization   amp now cbdc is good to be one of them
2260,"Dr Rajan, the guy who said mudhra loans will be a disaster."
2261,"You dont understand the topic itself, when you said that there is no real benefit of CBDC ..  By introducing CBDC   The digital cash systems ll be more secure and the ledger ll be distributed and there ll be no single point of failure.  As there is single source of truth then settlement ll be instantly and there ll be a huge cost saving in settlement.  3rd User ll have their own choice to keep custody of their own money in real sense by keeping thier money on non custodial wallet ..  that mean giving more power to people  4th CBDC is programable like NFTs so Govt can introduce various program and money that is intent to spend on those projects ll only be spent on those project and there is 0 possibility of leakages.   5 - all exisitng system ll be enabled to work ll UPI qnd they ll not be abandoned like you had mentioned..  Last but the most  I'mp .. influencer should not make video if they themselves have no knowledge on the topic"
2262,Very good analysis
2263,"I beg to disagree. I think India is getting ready to protect her interests against the monetary monopoly of arrangements like SWIFT, etc. If and when push comes to shove, with other countries adopting our CBDC, we will be in a position to withstand pressures like the ones exerted on Russia by the West, when they boycotted Russian institutions from the SWIFT payment network at the beginning of the Ukrain-Russia war."
2264,"Sir, suppose I bought 4 shares of company XYZ,  each. So, the total investment is Rs 40000. After a few months, I had a profit of Rs 10000 in my investment. Should I sell 1 share and buy a new share from a different company Will that be a good idea to do so"
2265,"Banks are crowded with people taking DBT, eRupi will clutter that I am happy "
2266,"From the end user perspective, CBDC dosent provide any advantage over UPI.  It can be useful in countries which doesnt have something like UPI, but dont see it getting adoption in India."
2267,"I dont know but when the whole world is trying to adopt and create their own digital currency  it is further refined  and develops the  block chain technology which is further used for  multiple applications... I'm not certain but  RBI is always face problems to tackle inflation when RBI do operation regarding inflation  curbing the commercial banks ignore or bent the guidelines, so might be possible that Rbi is concentrating more power ."
2268,To promote e-rupee now they have set limit on number of UPI transactions per day
2269,Does India have any advantage of creating CBDC to establish INR as reserve currency in BRICS trade Is that possible
2270,"Digital rupee has greater control and transperant than current digital money, life of each note can be traced and conyrolled, current digital money you know movement ofceach account not each note ie the big difference, through smart money you can force some notes valid for only some transaction (purchases) only not valid for other purchases etc so gov can channelise didital notes to specific transactions only."
2271,"you speaks very fast, should be little slow like  0.75x so that every new person digest the content."
2272,To face sanctions
2273,Tha Goverment should concentrate on monitoring how politicians hoard cash and take a cut on all Govt spendings. How many politicians will work for only salary. There is corrupt earning that is why politicians want to contest elections and come to power as they see good earning potential. This Govt is only after common peoples hard earned money.
2274,Receiving Remittances can be much more efficient via CBDC
2275,One of the reasons why I think the government n RBI is pushing it is to remove the intermediaries n for the transfer of money for direct benefit transfers n also to give various subsidies as its a pre programmable money. So yeah I hope it brings the efficiency that the system needs.
2276,"I fail to buy the argument that Dr. Rajan is honest or unbiased because he has played a pivotal role in developing UPI at initial stages... What a joke Intensions change... He might be influenced by the politicians in future or currently too... And most of the economist blabber non-sense.  I'm not here a supporter of any particular party, but generally this is what happens..."
2277,If it prevents money laundering by banks to the defaulters like Nirav modi and Vijay mallya bcoz of them banks shuts and common mans money stuck into banks like PMc for years then what is the problem with CBD... Centralisation is always better...
2278,One of the advantages is that there are no middle man needed ( eg swift ). Peer to peer payment can be done and done in real-time. That is why cost would be less. Now if cost could be lowered then good better exchange rates could be given for such transaction.  It would also be ready to use it for currency swaps in future between countries. US is already worried about there currency for the Chinese and moving to  digital dollars. India wants to  think in those lines.Advantage within india would be it would be highly efficient banking system especially recon. Going forwards a bank like HDFC could launch its own equalant of Visa credit cards.   Soon the govt. could create a use case for digital land transactions once the tech. Is in place linking backing and real estate not only for payments but for non tampered documents on blockchain too.
2279,How come CDBC  I'mparts more control on private banks
2280,CBDC can help in dealing with corruption in government. E.g Police can get ERUPE that can only be used to fule up the police car can not be spent anywhere else or govt can see where it spent.
2281,I think one advantage would be that even if bank servers are down then transactions will go thru unlike today where many a times you will psu banks UPI servers are down. Transactions will go thru because it will get recorded in central ledger and from there bank will update it’s node ledger. It won’t take away credit giving ability of the bank as money will still be in bank account. It will  I'mprove RB I'monitor bank customer service parameters. This has traditionally not worked in India. Banking customer service quality is very poor even in private banks except for foreign banks and may be Kotak. However CBDC will make customer flock to bank with better customer service if the banks are able to reduce banking fees because of CBDC.
2282,"Perhaps one of the benefits might be that if the system goes digital, transaction costs can be el I'minated  reduced, and it could result in greater profit margins for low-margin businesses and lower goods cost to the end-customer. This is assuming the large-scale adoption of e-Rupee and decline of the cash-economy. However, such a change is likely going to affect the job market since greater automation  disruption is usually followed by greater monetary losses and employee-lay-offs. However, I still agree that the benefits are not likely going to outweigh the costs."
2283,"If this is  I'mplemented successfully, it would be a great move in order to control banks."
2284,"I agree with you very strongly Akshat. There is NO NEED TO BRING CBDC. It is a very cheap effort from government to exert more control on people. And it has so many disadvantages. Indian people are now almost to the point where a major lot has learned to use UPI, not even net banking or bank apps. Majority does not know internet or apps. So we all Indians should protest this and not use it."
2285,I dont trust it bro all my privacy gone.
2286,I dont quite agree with your point here. CBDC is necessarily a digital version of physical currency. So everything that a bank does now .. can done with the e₹ too. I think your assumption of banks as mere keepers  distributors of physical currency isnt accurate.
2287,"What you are not talking about how different banks can be settle their transfers efficiently using CBDC  what takes 2 to 3 days happens within a few hours with CBDC - that is not being pointed out. That being said it does not really give an advantage to the retail users. However, this is a great tool for the settlement systems across the banks."
2288,Great analysis and Kudos to you for being honest in such difficult times Initially I thought you are trying to sell CBDC but thanks for being rationale on such a sensitive topic. I hope the reg I'me will not push it forcefully otherwise it will be Noteban 2.0.
2289,"Is this a way to circumvent the KYC norms so that dark and illegal money can be used by the governments and the powers that be. Of course, normal people can be surveilled by the powers that be"
2290,"With digital currency,there will be neither receipt of interest nor transactional charges. Theres no need to keep min I'mum balance,pay fines for defaults or charges by bank for transferring money via UPI from one bank to another. Bankruptcies are never expected,like in cooperative banks seen from time time in rural sreas"
2291,"In future, Govt can get a plan to make transactions by only using CBDC towards the entities where there are major risks of black money or illegal activities. For example, currently, since there are no ways to track where the crypto currency are used, Govt can  I'mplement the deposits and withdrawals only using CBDC and this way, they can question each citizens about their usages. S I'milarly in all those places where it is a risk illegal activities,  I'mposing the usages of CBDC only, can lower that."
2292,"thank you, very informational, thank you bro"
2293,"Happy to see someone say this. Even if you like the government and the current folks in power, remember that one day someone else will sit on that chair. This is why the best a well-intentioned gov can do is reduce its size, max I'mize freedoms and unleash creativity through low taxes and regulations."
2294,"Anything Digital-only is fraught with huge risks- as we saw in Canada, the gov shut down bank accounts of truckers as they didnt like the protests. UPI I can see the benefit of fast free transactions. CBDC is a globalist push to digital only world and social credit score and controlling and nudging behavior. Next, theyll say this money can only be used for gas and food. Then it becomes a mandatory amazon food voucher run by gov. Dystopian idea."
2295,Its e-Rupee sir. e-Rupi is something entirely else.
2296,"The notion that anything people do that gov should know itself is a totalitarian mindset. We, the people, are sovereign, its hte gov that needs to show us, its employer, how its spending the money, not the other way around."
2297,The whole idea behind decentralized currency is to prevent govt over printing and devaluing the currency and protecting your asets in that currency. Whats the point of a currency issued by a gov that is pegged to its fiat money and still be centralized Its the worst of both worlds.
2298,Thanks
2299,Nice content
2300,"Thanks bud for keepin us financially Educated Regardless of how bad it gets on the economy, I still make over $13,000 every single week"
2301,Thank you for s I'mple explanation can you make a chart stating the advantages and disadvantages of erupi. One of the main disadvantages I find is no interest on the digital wallet.
2302,The reason he is not promoting CBDC is because he knows what flak he got for promoting VAULD for crypto.
2303,Why bond lending % was higher during Mr Rajan
2304,"Hi Akshat Theres one thing I would like to know. Are these CBDCs uniquely traceable If so, then a unit specific ownership history could be made. This could allow us to identify illicit transactions. Thus discouraging and reducing such transactions."
2305,"Why Goverment sell asset that they own, if they themself print money unlimitedly BIGGEST DOUBT ."
2306,well explained Akshat
2307,as per rbi  currency print costs more than 5000 crores per year excluding maintenance and transportation
2308,Soon chip will come without chip you won’t be buy and sell
2309,wow perfect research
2310,There is no use of e-rupee. It will not successful as UPI.
2311,Agree on your point Cbdc are not anyway a game changer..
2312,Really good explanation of a very complicated topic...  I'm really  glad that i am subscribed to you.
2313,Finally govt. May decide everything what you can do with digital rupi and people may just be like slaves... already I doubt about the freedom of speech.
2314,Very informative content Akshat
2315,Wowww superb explanation
2316,no advantage over UPI only central govt having direct control over public pockets. and easy loans for adanis
2317,"Where does the Government  RBI get this e-Rupi from, to start issuing to Public What is the underlying asset that is, from where RBI can give the e-Rupi Are they going to s I'mply issue e-Rupi without any actual value of Rupee Or they would convert the existing Printed notes to e-Rupi and null those value of printed notes"
2318,Get an  I'mpression that this is a futile attempt by the government. Let’s wait and watch.
2319,Sir please explain what will be  I'mpact on property market by digital currency
2320,"The main motive is to replace physical cash transaction in due course of time which can better result in tax collection and avoid corruption. The govt cannot openly say this, atleast for now. But it still remains to be seen as this might take a very long time."
2321,The coverage is indepth and enlightening. Regarding savings for government vis a vis paper currency I think a huge amount of savings can be made in cash management costs . Not only printing but storage and  transportation costs are very high. Banks and RBI has to maintain huge currency chests in so many locations. The efforts in safe transportation of currency from bank branches to their currency chests and rbi chests is huge and security costs are high. Also rbi has to pay interest on the cash of banks.
2322,The main reason for introducing CBDC is that all the BRICS nations are introducing a currency of their own which is gold backed and it’s supposed to compete with USD  CBDC can easily exchanged with this new currency easily as it is more centralised  In the short term u r right but when u think of the future CBDC is definitely helpful International trade will become a hell lot easier
2323,Thanks Akshat Good job of explaining complex things in s I'mple words
2324,eRupi and CBDC are two entirely different things
2325,When CBDC is same as digital money why do you think it will not earn interest Govt can also crack whips on cash hoarders and hawala traders. It also will be a game changer for international trade. Many countries want to move away from dollar-based transactions to avoid US sanctions.
2326," There is a mistake here, e-RUPI is not same as e-RUPEE"
2327,"After CBDC, Central Government will save the per transaction cost which is paid by the Finance Ministry to the respective bank for performing transaction(for the service provided).  As CBDC allows RBI to give the service to the customer directly Finance Ministry  Central Government will manage to save heavy amount."
2328,One s I'mple reason- public is not bearing any expenditure. The day public is forced to bear charges for using UPI user will go down exponentially.
2329,Digital currency means your money can be confiscated by the Government at the click of a mouse. Government is desperate to control publics money.
2330,Your video help me a lot today. Discussion started in office  Thanks a lot
2331,Just seeing spams and bots gdp increases as refferal code and see the likes on that comment all are more than the rest comments without refferal code so much of bots
2332,"Thank you very much Akshay, for the clear cut explanation"
2333,Very  very nicely explained. Thanks a lot
2334,Public sector bank staffs will struggle to understand and use it. First govt should train them.
2335,rupee
2336,"Right now when we say 92% of money is in some digital format, i dont think that means there is no physical cash associated with, I actaully think, lets say we hold 1lakh in digital format say bank account, then, bank holds that physical cash in their side, so CBDC would avoid this holding of physical cash and its printing,  you havent mentioned it this way, pls evaluate my theory )"
2337,Hi Akshat  can you talk about the   quotSecurities Lending Income Program   quot in Vested in your upcoming video
2338,"UPI became successful only after opening Jan Dhan Bank account for each and every citizen till the ground level and  I'mplementing Demonetization after that, then after citizens forced to adopt this change and now it became a success story. Everything was well thought and planned."
2339,Pls do a seperate vlog on Laws governing apps like INDmoney grow ect used for investment …worried after FTX collapse
2340,CBDC can be good alternative to large B2B transactions which need not to go through commercials banks
2341,Mobile battery khatam ho jane se Kay karu
2342,good MEANS
2343,Sir please make a video on dhirubhai ambani.
2344,"Hi, great analysis on CBDC. From where I am looking at it seems like the government is trying to el I'minate physical cash from the economy. This also points to lesser instances of black cash getting stashed."
2345,This government wants to make IND a china. Crazy intentions to flush money out of its nationals pocket.
2346,Basically  billions of public money wasted  again due to  I'mporper governance
2347,"Nice video. But, are you sure  RBI using Blockchain technology to introduce e-Rupee or something else"
2348,inshort - No benefit
2349,CBDC real value comes in with Invoice payments.. we can discuss it if you have time..
2350,Rajan is a Marxist goon
2351,HI Akshat - I don’t think RBI CBDC is directly managed and issued by RBI.  This is done through intermediary banks.   You can read the RBI circular on 29 Nov.  Agree that there are no major advantages seen from a retail perspective.   Thanks for s I'mplifying the concept of CBDC
2352,Facts presented in this video are incorrect and misleading. Please do some more research.
2353,"Who begged the contract to develop cbdc systems tcs, infosis"
2354,A deadly   with sweet
2355,No intrest is obnoxious
2356,"Can a poor people or common people who do not have mobile phones use this   quot E-rupi   quot and how, please explain it to all 140 crore peoples of India so that each and every person can easily understand it  understand them in their language.  Dont make such video that already have been uploaded by others youtubers. Namaskar."
2357,"I wonder, even now people are getting  I'mpressed by comments of Mr.  Raghuraman Rajan"
2358,Demonetization with CBDC would have been effective.
2359,"2 benefits i see of CBDC counterfeit notes production will get  I'mpacted if people start using CBDC due to which terrorist organizations will get  I'mpacted and also economy will benefit as counterfeit currency pumping inflates the countrys economy tracking of the money becoems easier, so govt will know that this piece to 100 E-Rup I'moved from person A to person B and right now is in the hands of person C and if the movement made economic sense."
2360,Hi Akshay. I have been following ur videos for some time now. You have been doing tremendous job so far.  When i saw ur video on cbdc i got interested to know what would you say about. There are several details missed out in your presentation which  I'may discuss with you over a call.  Pl do let me know if you wd be interested. Thanks
2361,when can we buy your courses which are sold
2362,its looks like the creater want 15 minute video otherwise it can b done in 5 minute.
2363,Govt. Sees cbdc as a tool to curb black money . Other than this i dont see any rational purpose. Last time it was Notebandi (exchange your notes) this time they are silently doing it . Before we know they will  I'mplement retail e rupee as mandatory for some fractions. Accumulation of black money can  seriously be challenged with this in coming future. I see precious metals being used as black money in the future . I dont know how right I am  if I am totally wrong   future will tell.
2364,Pl listen to idfc chairman comments on erupi
2365,But which type of blockchain it is POS POW or ...
2366,"Thats a very socialist approach from govt. Why is govt doing that, i heard that the BRICS nation are also trying to come up with  a digital currency among themselves which will be backed by gold. Is moving away form fiat currencies a wise decision for emerging economies This might seriously hurt the creation of credit"
2367,You aask too many questions before start of YouTube
2368,when is the next batch coming on stock market
2369,One key point This e-Rupee will also be a programmable rupee which can only be used where it is intended to be. So its all about control.
2370,Physical rupee notes will be done away with soon. Big savings in cost  paper  transportation  physical storage  etc and benefits environment too. Not sure why you cant see the benefits.
2371,e-Rupi and e-rupee is different. CBDC you’re talking about is e-rupee but you’re thumbnail shows e-Rupi which is wrong
2372,True Banking system may affect. but in future conventional lending process might change. If conventional lending process changes economy will be more stable in terms of NPAs. To invest People might buy bonds or some kind of financial product to lend to companies.
2373,"Solid video and thanks for breaking it down... Despite the economic downturn,  I'm happy Ive been earning 12,600$ from my 2,000$ investment every 9 days"
2374,Is this s I'milar to the crypto BS*  %^
2375,One  I'mpratant point is that it can theoretically enable digital money transfer in offline mode.
2376,"CBDC concept is very hazy at thus stage and operational mechanism would get evolved over the pilot phase. Some of your assertions ( egFunds flow to Banking system will get curtailed and eventually may affect the economic activity) is bit premature at this stage. My belief is, eventually this mechanism may be used to control and monitor large- value commercial  transactions for understandable reasons. Nevertheless, your video provides good understanding at the concept level."
2377,It is not clear as to how the problem of double spending will be resolved when money gets transferred from one wallet to another with out underlying blockchain.
2378,"E-Rupee is what I think s I'milar to digital Yaun the Chinese is planning to unleash.....  People might think its technological advancements...but its instrument of Authoritarian control, yes  Thats how China designed its whole financial system around Digital Yuan....  Indian Government the trying to convert India into theocratic Autocracy, to excercise more tighter control trying to bring something s I'milar I believe"
2379,b  as the war comes all market cap of companies will get erased due to all their units destroyed. Survive that first. I will never pay such market valuations. Inflation is on hyper hyper levels. This nonsense is the least of anyones problems    b
2380,Very nice video sir..
2381,"Goverments are misusing their power and spending money on freebies. Majority of politicians are corrupted.   Though the technology is good, it might be misused by governments.  Even common people are used to this black cash concept to avoid taxes. It is very difficult to introduce a fair accounting financial system in India.  Just my thoughts."
2382,Cdcs are mainly used for cross border payments between institutions and countries  the scope for the general public will come later ...
2383,Firstly E RUPI is different from E rupee. Learn more about it before making a video.
2384,"There is a mistake in your explanation, Even if the money is in your bank account bank has to keep physical cash in lieu with that money in your account. Also any new money that comes into the system RBI has to print cash and give it to banks,  Incase of e₹ RBI will give banks money not in cash but in digital form . So currently any money in the system (whether in bank account) will have to have a physical note somewhere but this will not be the case with launch of e₹"
2385,"As an RBI Employee i can tell you all know about the advantages of digital rupee once you visit the issue section of RBI. You dont have any idea how much labour cost, technology cost and time it takes to complete one life cycle of a single note.  Regarding your concern about centralised control, any scheme in nascent condition needs to be controlled by people who are experts in that field  my belief once the digital rupee infrastructure gets well developed control will be decentralised."
2386,Thank you      for info
2387,I agree this is misadventure which this govt. wants to do with no advantage to public. Nobody needs this currency which govt wants to push down the throat of Indian public.
2388,"Had my doubts, wanted to see govt. argument....turns out govt. is running behind FOMO. CBDC in China is going to be used to essentially subdue the population financially and keep them in check. If seen getting out of line cbdc in China will essentially make you unable to spend money bcoz your identity will be linked. S I'mply put its not only CBDC but a version of programmable currency and to see what havoc that plays in the economy just wait and see after these Covid lockdown protests in China."
2389,As a crypto invester understand your hater for government digital money
2390,very good content. good research
2391,"Either you did not do proper research on this or you failed to make us understand. Gives  me an  I'mpression, almost you are very critical of  digital rupee..You did not make any comments on digital trial,how it could be used to reduce corruption, how this could also b used  to  help  DBT money to b used exclusively to the purpose it was given by govt,I dont  think any sensible govt would  b wasting time and money if its of no use to economy.Many countries are in the process of adopting this technology, and taking China example   my opinion is absolutely nonsense coz any kind of tec can be misused in china.."
2392,"Despite the economic downturn,  I'm happy ☺️. I have been earning $60,200 returns from my $10,000 investment every 13 days"
2393,Nobody is telling the viewers that CBDC eRupee is indeed Demonetization 2.0
2394,"As usual excellent and crystal clear explanation of both the pros and cons of the format, where given the mindset of the ruling party ( read as individuals) cons out weigh the pros. Lets see what happens."
2395,"Hey Akshat, is there any possibility of risk of getting hacked"
2396,"this upcoming reply is to c-h-e-c-k whether any b-o-t s responding,    invest in gold or digital currencies ( BTC  ETH )  "
2397,What will be the effect of CBDC on real estate prices in the long term.
2398,"Completely disagree with your analysis here, seems like you are afraid of people going away from your so called investment   quotcrypto  quot due to RBI digital rupee. Also you did not highlight the benefits of rupee."
2399,"Everything looks good in hayday... In india  a) Banks are being heavily regulated. Apart from some cooperative banks failing, banking is fairly stable... But this is not everywhere including usa.. and this can change very quickly.. like how Yes Bank was bankrupt... So in that case people loose money.. due to banks... That is where cbdc comes as a mechanism to have money.. rather tham stashing in gold or other asset.  b) Today UPI is free for retail because govt is paying...  I'magine tomorrow per UPI transaction cost becomes high...   So per transaction cost for UPI Is always higher than per transaction of cbdt... Because of the complexity of process ..  c) UPI is dependent on banks. Lets say tomorrow a bank server crashes.. or a bank backs out of UPI... How will the customers of that bank use UPI ... CBCD removes that.."
2400,Modi ji doesnot know nothing about money (currency) and you dont be a sanghi
2401,Nothing is self executable everything is controlled and monitored by central planners
2402,I have a question what if this system hacked
2403,How is CBDC an  I'mpact on credit lending  Finance cos like HDFC still attract deposits from customers to finance their lending business. The same model will continue - to get interest one will be able to place deposits at an interest rate by paying from CBDC. Mr Rajan loves to create issues out of nowhere and surprising you endorse h I'm.
2404,Hindi
2405,So much of explanation  I'm just 1 video great  it up
2406,"If commercial banks are not gonna benefitted, why are they participating in phase mannered pilot runs.."
2407,Haha..true..no much benefits
2408,"Centralisation gives more power to govt., and  I'm not sure what they will do to us, may be more govt employees can choose for corruption."
2409,"Excellent videos, you always make tough concepts easy  )"
2410,Follow process what USA and Japan are following.. rather than Chinese government process.. useless E rupee
2411,E-rupi is not CBDC retail. E-Rupee is CBDC retail. Please Correct ur heading. E-rupi is like voucher.
2412,Cbdc is dangerous you speak anything against government they will seize your e rupee and will just give you a notice
2413,Step 1  introduce digital rupee. Step 2  make it easy to use for even lower class Step 3  make digital currency a habit Step 4  restrict physical currency withdrawal Step 5  ban physical currency and make money digital. Could be a great idea to make courruption literally zero if  I'mplemented correctly.
2414,What if CBDC is fully  I'mplemented and physical currencies are take out of circulation Will it not curb the curruption and terrorism Please give your insights  Thanks  for an excellent presentation
2415,I think u should become consultant to RBI
2416,Too judgmental… no information…
2417,Only 21 banks partner with e-Rupi
2418,Raghuram Rajan is a big joke
2419,hi Akshat  Thanks for such an informative video on CBDC. Really appreciate this video because right from the announcement of CBDC I really didnt understood what real advantage does it provide to a common man. finally theres a video  information point on internet that explains it in relatively s I'mple terms.  Thanks Again )
2420,"when social media came out it was hoped that it will strengthen individual liberty and for while it did, then govts and the elites used it to divide up people spreading propaganda creating echo chambers, and censoring the truth. CBDC will also be used by tyrannical govts to snatch away your economic freedom and liberty. money.  I'magine one day waking up and seeing either no money or having your money being frozen by the govt just because you decided to speak against the injustice of the govt"
2421,Is Cbdc will be it in crypto on  exchanges
2422,Easy of doing transaction
2423,Black money is not explained well
2424,Akshat you explained the CDBC in such a way people will in confusion state.
2425,You are anti BJP Modi
2426,"If we consider CBDC to be equivalent to physical notes, then cant the govt in near future do another demonitization of say all denomination notes above Rs 100, but this time give everyone e rupi in place of physical currency  All currency above Rs 100 can br banned. They can then solve the issue of black money in the economy. No one can keep e rupi as black money right "
2427,Lets see...If it is useless...Ult I'mately govt rolls it back...So bold decisions are necessary... Some may hit some may fail...
2428,We know pivotal role of Raghuraman n Chidambaram n Antonios nexus.
2429,First e rupee... Bank to bank transactions(its useful instead of purchasing bonds etc etc) 2nd e rupee for retailers.. I think here retailers means for  bussiness bigger transactions..Already they will maintain current accounts with bank.. Its plan to curb black. hidden money from market. Govt didnt say about banks.. I think its useful for companies and bussiness people not for common man Govt already gave upto 19 dec for any suggestions..We can use it for our queries... But financial reforms are  needed whether it will be good or bad future will say . If I am wrong can correct me...
2430,"* I will forever be indebted to you, you have changed my entire life and I will continue to preach on your name for the world to hear that you save me from huge financial debt with little investment thank you very much Expert Mrs... Clara"
2431,the only advantage of CBDC might be cross border payments but it will require standardized payment interface among different CBDCs of different countries.  This might make the cross-border money transfer process fast and less costly (lesser fee). But this  I'mplementation will take time as most of the countries are not ready with their CBDCs and such standardized payment interface is not even in design phase.
2432,not just Raghuram Rajan mostly even you talk against the govt... Chinese economy is standing in a way better place than our even after their crisis ... it is only because India has only played safe.... CBDC can significantly reduce black money.... when you can trust in other digital currencies why not CBDC At least it is legit I'mised by an elected govt which ias very difficult to be overthrown in a massive country like ours... It might even cause anarchy.... You want me to trust some crypto regulator but not my own Govt if govt wanted they could nationalise banks as well just like they did in 1950s... We are more free today than we ever were.
2433,no possibility for black money
2434,Still remember what P Chidambaram said about future of UPI. It will fail.
2435,If we can control inflation and the intrest rates are zero.  The more money wil be out in the market and we can boost our progress.   But what controls inflation
2436,wow
2437,It is Indian governments e-wallet money.
2438,"1. Low internet penetration 2. Huge un banked economy, semi urban, rural, even cities still prefer cash 3. Digital economy is still for the lucky few Dont really why how it would compete  alternate with existing UPI.  infra"
2439,SBI left the chat by the end of video
2440,"Yeah even I had the same feeling when I first heard about CBDC. Its practically useless, and centralization can never be good for anyone"
2441,Hi..aksat..as i thik this will greatly affect..middle class and lower middle class families...it will b harder for these people to live on....as most of people have a small job or no job...  amp mainly depends on d interest on small savings..in d bank...
2442,"He dont talk about any advantage. I think one, if transaction is done by people to people without internet, and without bank involvement like giving hard cash to another person. That is revolutionary."
2443,Hiii akshat I would like to know more clearly thou u did manage to cover up almost all bullet points however if there are more disadvantages then positive changes of cbs then wts the whole point of govt wanting to introduce to mass by wasting huge masses money itself (as ur said there are more negative pls then being positive of  I'mplementing such a whole new money system be it in physical or digital format pls explain in detail in new video with regards to my query thks-keep up the gud work   amp I appreciate ur precious time   amp efforts to explain such intruige topics in very less time
2444,If someone ask Comisson or brabery can I pay h I'm e rpee
2445,Tq
2446,"The problem unforeseen is that a gray market will flourish where digital currency will be converted into physical currency for a cost....thereby making mismatch equivalent to what happens to an economy if counterfeit currency is half of total currency....then policy decisions based on logistics becomes off the mark.... another fatal outcome would be that cbdc can be programmed to suit a community, section of society, caste, or even religion, no one else can use the token except the intended party...."
2447,"In my opinion e-rupi will be used for giving loans. Bank will issue loan only in e-rupi, this will decrease the willfull defaulter NPA."
2448,"too much speculation and extrapolation of chines cameras analogy, also making CDBC vs UPI and Jam, not very coherent narrative against rupee advantages"
2449,Well explained sir .   U made it so s I'mple
2450,It seems you are a great fan and  admirer of Raghuram Rajan. So no point in telling you the advantages of DC. As the people like you have already made up negative mindset. Best thing is to unsubscribe you   which  I'm going to do after posting this comment.
2451,"I did not get this point, how this is going to harm the general public "
2452,gd news
2453,ᴛʜᴀɴᴋꜱ
2454,I dont think how He got information from China Gov Intrest  Their own citizens dont get the gov Data But Indians get it   I an sure CBDC is one of best syetem ever in Financs system . People using Android can get into CBDC very very soon and earn its benifit as service charges are non available  and physical cash will pinch service charges from pocket   This Report is half knowledge about CBDC ..
2455,"I thought cbdc digital rupee was a counter to  crypto, basically RBI controlled crypto for the public.....  ERupi is a digital voucher  so the spend happens where it is meant for n misappropriation of funds do not happen."
2456,"Well people who know, will know  CBDC is the final nail on SWIFT and US monopoly"
2457,"Hi  Awesome finance learning from your channel. I have little money saved and hail from a lower middle class family. I want to make smart investments other than traditional FDs (where actually  I'm in loss as FD rates not even match inflation). How to select where else... and how could I invest smartly with lesser risk as Ive very little margin I can play with. If I want to select mutual funds then how should I find which MF is best for me and how to invest Whether I should go with gold bonds or buying physical gold, which option should I go for and how If I want to go with Debt bonds then need a way. Kindly guide me if possible as per how should I go ahead and not get confused. Will always be indebted for the knowledge you share. Thanks a lot...."
2458,Very well explained
2459,When Upi was introduced people also questioned it but everyone knows how upi helped us grow in a better way
2460,"It more looked like a politically motivated video, Every country in world is mad according to this guy, each and every country is trying to introduce CBDC  atleast please don’t use your channel for politics."
2461,"This is clearly an additional way of keeping digital currency. Neither govt is forcing nor you are bound to use. This will work like the wallet of paytm Or phonepay where you dont get interest. So in any wallet system, you dont get interest. Only when you want to use, you can transfer and use. I dont see any risks absolutely. Comparing with china.. Its a shame. Everyone knows how China is controlled. It is good to argue, but intentions should be correct"
2462,E-RUPI IS DIFFERENT AND E-RUPEE IS BOTH HAVE DIFFERENT WORK TO DO...
2463,"Did not give any proper information on the eRupi and how the transactions will take place. How is it different from UPI and will it need internet connection  The whole focus looked like political speech.  Interesting we are very open to give our information to google, ethereum, and so on..  but somehow dont want our govt. to know what we are doing.  Many countries including US, Europe are introducing digital currency. Why give example of only china It shows  the intention to give half information to creat a wrong  I'mpression."
2464,Thanks
2465,Only benefit I see is being able to make payments even when there is zero connectivity with internet.  I do use GPay. I have linked a Zero Balance account with it where in I keep no more than ₹ 2000  - to limit my risk in the event of hacking or physical loss of the phone.  So even in this case if I were to get an account or what ever I would maintain no more than a couple thouand rupees as emergency should I get stranded in the middle of  nowhere and need to pay someone. So no matter what the landing capacity of commercial banks is not going to be affected much. For me there is ZERO incentive to subscribe to this service.
2466,I have answer what is the real a I'm of CBDC  To enslave you
2467,"Cbdc will require a lot of servers to handle, government should rethink"
2468,You forgot to mention some points 1. Cbdc will be a substitute to swift network and others. Like in 2016 usa banned iran from selling oil... india could not use any payment channel to trade..so it has to abide to usa terms.  2. It will benifit atmarnirbhar bharat by linking with upi as it is free and there is no fee on any transactions unlike in usa and other capitalistic countries.  3. In near future we may even see atm getting obsolete as maintaining physical cash is a burden to government..so all my get digital.  4. As the e-rupi is backed by rbi as legal tender.. so in any fraud cause.. when someone swipe away ur funds..there is less chance u vll get it back...as today banks dont take responsibilities for any cybercr I'me... this will make rbi liable to give compensation to citizens.  Overall its a smart move by rbi to bring such remarkable instruement .
2469,Benefits of CBDC is control of corruption  This single benefit will change fate of India
2470,One benefit will be the reduction in corruption in different central and state government project execution. The money can be tracked if it is being used for the purpose it has been assigned for. Please watchout p gurus channel for more info.
2471,"Unlike other cryptocurrencies, the digital rupee would be backed by the RBI. This will mitigate the risk of volatility."
2472,very useful video...
2473,Excellent analysis
2474,It is being promoted for central funded scheme in states so that centre can track the money and corruption is min I'mised.
2475,"Starting early is the best way of getting ahead to build wealth, investing remains a priority. The stock market has plenty of opportunities to earn a decent payouts, with the right skills and proper understanding of how the market works."
2476,Here is the honest opinion i am watching akshat video since when he has 7 lakh followers in his previous videos he used to say facts and let us decide our good and bad but now i am seeing he is forcing his opinions and presenting this is god for economy this is bad for economy as per his limited knowledge either he cla I'ming he knows much better than all experts on economy or rbi executive or banks senior executive or he is just a fool trying to become wannabe intellectual you tell me how many of you have benefited from his financial adviice of spending money either in blockchain based crytocurrencies or in any shares he suggested i would love to know.
2477,do you make interest on cash in wallet E-Rupi is same except in digital form where you no longer need to carry wads of notes in pocket...nothing less nothing more.
2478,Enable is pronounced as In-able not un-able. Sounds weird to hear it as unable )
2479,"There is no interest,  no return on Investment how can it be a alternative to cryptocurrency"
2480,"Isnt it our money right now is digital and physical moneywhy do we need digital currency when we are using digital money thru UPI,"
2481,"If everyone is using UPI and if we pay directly from our account to other account isnt that call digital money,do we need another digital moneyi think what we are doing is just fine,we can pay  using UPI and when we want cash we can withdraw from ATM and i think is is just perfect."
2482,"Absolutely wrong interpretation of digital Rupi by Akshat. You are s I'mply misguiding people against an  excellent format of currency, Akshat. This digital currency will largely min I'mize the leakage of DBT money. Lot other benefits are also there."
2483,"The biggest problem in India is tracking government money allocated to needed people that will be solved, dont expect one  I'mplementation can solve everything in india"
2484,The major reason is central government is subsidizing upi transaction due to multiple merchants involved  as amount of upi transactions are increasing leaps and bounds it will cost lot more. There might be possiblity that in future upi transactions are charged as well like  I'mps so CBDC could be an alternative to that plus adoption of blockchain technology which is transparent and much safe as well could be promoted.
2485,Great Analysis....
2486,great video as usual
2487,UPI was not developed and institutionalised by raghuram rajan...  It was Nandan nilenkani team that developed india stack...
2488,"I see this being used to provide Govt subsidies directly to people and reduce misuse of these money. Example, I have seen farmers take agri loans and buy cars and other luxury items. If the smart contracts are brought into action, govt  banks will put the erupi into bank account and the farmer can only use it for fertilizers, seeds  plantations, rentals for agri based vehicles and services and so on. This way we are plugging the leaks in a more polite manner. If govt takes action, then majority of the people will start protesting - hence this step. I could be wrong, but its only another way of understanding."
2489,no words i am just 200% agreed
2490,"S I'mply awesome  sir, the topic is indeed complex but you made it too lucid for any amateur... thanks "
2491,Its not bank fd and sb for earning interest
2492,e-rupi is purpose specific there is no cash involvement anywhere whereas in DBT beneficiary gets direct money which gives discretionary power to use this money for any purpose even purchasing gutka too... a  c to me e-rupi is just one step ahead in initiating welfare to the people efficiently.
2493,"The best use for cbdc with a centralized ledger is to make sure we have a transparent system between loans being given to states from the center and its utilization by states and vice versa for revenues being collected from states as part of cgst and sgst. If cbdc centralized ledger can utilise this through blockchain  it gives the citizens a lot of insight . But in relation to the video, the options where this is being utilized make no sense "
2494,CBDC is a Digital prison for the whole world. The sooner people recognise this the better it is. CBDC is the best tool for any dictatorial authoritarian rule. CBDC can be used to shut any individual or a group permanently just by switching them off digitally. Any one having different political opinion other than the government in control can be isolated permanently from the illusory digital financial services. You s I'mply dont exist. Dangerous trend.
2495,"Blind rush to technology will lead to disaster. First,all the adhaar cards of dead be deactivated. A life certificate every six months is necessary. Any account without living certificate should be blocked.There are chances of benami and dummy accounts  hiding black money. Some food for the government before doing gaga under technology. Best known fact is no bank spends  on security,also the government.Block chain will make it difficult to trace  the identity. Its easy for RBI to declare  policy  to save the banks and execute the customer for the system fault.All like MALLAYA AND MODI WILL BE AWAY FROM THE COUNTRY."
2496,1.Easy money transfer between countries in bilateral trades 2.BRICS is working on a currency to counter USD domination in market and it is said that this currency will be a digital currency backed by gold or even commodities because recently Saudi wants to join the BRICS 3. So according to me the use of this type of currency is more on the international trade rather than domestic
2497,Vo you know something As a complete layman I wondered ( and wonder now) what benfit to the concumer or the government the e-rupi( CBDC) would bring. I am relieved that you think that there would be no benefit at all. So  I'm going to eatch this space.
2498,Awesome
2499,"The adoption of CBDC for revenue expenditure is going to help curb the wide spread corruption. By making it mandatory to make all contraual work payments through CBDC tokens only, which normally generate significant portion of black money, it would make all such transactions open for investigation. Having said that, the system must overcome the shortcoming you mentioned to make it more viable for wider usage."
2500,Thanks a lot
2501,"Wonderfully explained  Thank you for clarifying, i was also confused."
2502,what about if banks starts to charge for upi payments then e rupi can play crucial role
2503,"are you a puppet of  I'mF, WORLD BANK   amp INDIAN GOVT. which explain this matter not with a cons only with pros why"
2504,In short CBDC is a merchant account with the RBI instead of having an account with commercial bank. And this might be backed by a block chain infrastructure.
2505,There is no point in breaking your head about what is CBDC and how its different from the old system and why the govt. is struggling to communicate the benefits of CBDC to the public. The reality is that it wipes off currency notes from the system and the CBDC is a   quotprogrammable currency  quot. The govt will now have a complete control on your spending as it will programme the currency in a way that you can spend a part of your money only on specific  designated items in the economy. In s I'mple the Govt. can decide where you spend the money and how much you should spend and even whether it should block your money if you speak against the govt. This is nothing but the beginning of the SOCIAL CREDIT SYSTEM. When the Pr I'me Minister of the country shouts at the top of his voice about the   quotNew World Order  quot in the Parliament several times since past few years why isnt the public serious about it and still believe that these are just conspiracy theories.
2506,A great explanation akshat ur eloquancy and knowledge are truly outstanding
2507,"It felt strange that you went so soft on e-Rupi. Government can invalidate your e-Rupi after certain period of time if you do not spend the money in order to keep economy in good shape. Government can prevent you from spending your own money on some of the things if they want to. With e-Rupi government can directly debit the money from your account with out your permission if you participate in dharnas, protests etc. Basically Government can enforce everything it wants, crushing individual freedom, choice. We all know what happens to such societies."
2508,"Sir,  I sincerely believe this is a Politically sponsored content to defame the present Govt. by comparing it with Chinese Govt.  Now, redo your Research, keeping the following points in mind Have you ever seen the trucks loaded with cash, picking up notes and coins from each Branch and ATM across India Are you aware of the cost of printing a Note, replacing the torn notes, cost of minting a coin and do you believe The Govt. of India is losing money from it Are you aware of the massive counterfeit notes being circulated in the Economy and the losses the Banks and RBI bears by exchanging them with genuine currency in genuine cases Are you aware of the cost of  I'mporting the Ink and paper used in printing currency notes Are you aware what percentage of population still do not have Bank Accounts or Mobile phones Are you aware of the cost of internet on mobiles and the distribution of education of users  using the apps and percentage of users using non-smart phones Are you aware that Demonetisation happened to min I'mise the use of bigger currency notes which at present does not take into account Cash Transactions. All this will give a true picture of Real size of Indian Economy and will help us get closer to the $5Tn target. It is absolutely not to track every user and datapoints, my dear.  I hope, it helps you in getting a   quotThink out the Box  quot perspective of what the Govt. and RBI have in mind.  All these are my personal observations and thoughts and do not represent anything else."
2509,jam yojana will be introduced because currently government is giving money to farmers and poor people. but government cant control how people will spend this money. so they will create voucher. which will people avail only on specific shops. for example if you are giving 5000₹ worth of voucher to farmer he can avail in fertiliser shops or equipment shops only. that way money will not be wasted for other purposes.
2510,Sir it may not succeed because politicians Nd businesses man cannot hide black money . This is my thought.
2511,"Its e-rupee n not e-rupi, Misleading content"
2512,see think school video
2513,I totally did not get the point where the Chinas people surveillance system is compared with the CBDT
2514,"Main purpose of CBDC is to create an Internationally tradable currency without using any of the current payment networks like Swift, which are controlled by West. In an eventual case of sanctions as in case of Russia where Swift payments were blocked disrupting trade this would help.   So in case CBDC is successful we would have a mechanism in place to trade globally without much disruption.  Second reason is INR is highly dependent on USD and hence is volatile. If trade happens in INR,  I'mporters   amp exporters need not worry of Currency risk.  Making INR more stable,  creating lot value for business in the long run."
2515,"The Govt. officials like corporators and MLAs are doing some scams in a different way that they are wasting lots of money to build unnecessary gates, banners and statues, etc. and also doing district, taluka, railway station etc re-naming process.. This money is our Taxes so way they are doing it and wasting so much money. Whether its really needed to do this.   Even when they took their meetings they are just enjoying their lunch, dinner, etc. This also our Tax money .. why  We giving the power to them all this shit "
2516,This is being done to end the role of comml banks  because now there will be no need to open bank accounts . And gen public is going to be hit hard because than only few 2  3 banks will remain and wont give even 6 % int like present. Public will have to invest in capital fds  thereby benefitting cspitalists .
2517,"Hi Akshat, my knowledge of CBDC is all from this video, but heres the benefit I see  Since this system skips the layer of private banks during transactions, this will bring enormous transparency and accountability on transactions.  Think about the following - Tax transparency - Debt    Loan transparency - International transactions accountability (funding of terror and    or black money)  Also, since CBDC is a blockchain network (centralised, but anyway) it can also make eRupi an alternative for blockchain applications    businesses to use instead of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Although, Polygon or other blockchains might be a better choice at the moment, but its the first initiative by Govt in the blockchain space and with time it might actually evolve into a viable option.  It mostly benefits the government, but I dont consider the   quotjanta  quot to be separate from the government. I dont think this a zero sum game between government and the masses.  Again I am not sure about how it works and if these benefits will ever occur, but this is what I can see right now"

2522,Thank you sir great job
2523,"Hello Akshat, need some help and advice. I had sent money from my bank account to Vested direct account. I then changed my mind and want to withdraw money out of it. But unable to do it. Can u help please"
2524,Very sad that govt is taking complete control of public money. Yes the top govt officials and politicians will have control of your and my money and has every chance of duping the public at large. This is like china that our govt too wants to control our money and miss use them for their benefit.
2525,This system of govt control can and sure one day bring india into bankruptcy. Very dangerous trend and system of governence.
2526,Soon other banks will close because they will have no work hence banks will close and RBI will take complete control.. Then there will be no physical currency in circulation rupee will die and only digital rupee of RBI will function. This will be another disaster like demonetzation of indian rupee complete. God save india from disaster. Very bad future.poor man will be at hardship to survive.
2527,If u want to beat around the bush..please dont put titles to confuse viewers..u are wasting time..
2528,looks like you are reacting too early like small children and popcorn youtubers. reference to rajan and uguhrs shows your where you are heading. please restrain from one sided views .
2529,i think there are fallacy in your argument.  RBI is not getting into credit.  it has been issuing notes in physical form  not is issuing in digital currency  the currency in circulation even today is decided by RBI  Finance ministry  there is not transparent formula that is being used or public by neither rbi nor finance ministry.  in fact RBI has started SGL-for bonds and now citizen open the account directly. this is to save the cost for the GOI as they had to pay money to the intermediaries being bank.
2530,"Will RBI Do the mining to issue Digital rupee like z,Bitcoin etc "
2531,"Very nicely explained. Yes, private banks will be starved of money for loan purpose. Maybe govt wants to monitor pvt banks that extend loans."

2538,"Taking Piyush Goyal and Raghuram Rajan statement is so lame. Also the video does not do justice to the point that it can help targetted DBT, e.g. money given for fertilizer can be used for intended purpose.   Another lame and funny argument was, why you created JAM, when you had to create e-rupi. Bro - theres is a word called evolution and concurrent existence of two systems is alright. NEFT, UPI,RTGS all exist today.  There are multiple other stupid argument as well,"
2539,"it is centerlized control, I dont see any benifit of it."
2540,Nice information thank you so much sir explain very easy and s I'mple language English I understand. My English is very week but I understanding
2541,big disaster
2542,Is it not due to crypto currencies popularity that government is also launching its own official crypto currency what about tamper proof and auditing capabilities Arent they advantages of digital currency
2543,great job bro for making such we’ll explained video
2544,"Comparing Chinese Musl I'ms problem with CBDC was really stupid  When we have technology where no middleman (banks) are required, why to give chance of any manipulation.  Corruption is eating the whole country from years and with small reasons now people shall be given chance to do anything they want. Anyways RBI already collects data from the banks with information system which is mandatory for banks to provide."
2545,One of the main advantages of this new distributed ledger is it will not leave any scope for physical intentional tampering of the subledgers held by the banks which eventually leads to an incomplete main ledger visible to the RBI.
2546,"Good Video. But it is premature to conclude that it doesnt have major advantage. Just  I'magine a use case On successful testing of CBDC, if Govt comes with a decision of all major transactions more than 10L(just an example), must be via CBDC, this may remove black money (For Ex. Real estate, Gold purchase etc.,).Lets wait and watch"
2547,the centralised control of everything is always has its threats. this move can even make easy to stash black money and transactions. cool
2548,Digital Rupee won’t change anything right now but in future it might help Govt to track black money if adopted on wide scale
2549,"thank you so much, it was really helpful."
2550,"Pl go slow to understand it would be easier,"
2551,"Government will have all the knowledge of flow of money  this will help them to collect more tax from middle class family, earlier it was easier to save by family,  Every thing is changing buy why not Govt is increasing its basic exemption limit from last more than 5 year basic exemption is fixed 2.5  3  5 lakh   Why 80c deduction is only Till 1.5 lakh from last many year   There are very different Questions which Government must think ."
2552,E-Rupi  Ability to give Loans directly to corp-orates by RBI ( practically Government)  is little bit dangerous as Capitalists are controlling most of the government policies by funding elections which in turn is returned by cheap loans to them . Disaster is waiting ahead if this Adani  Ambani fails . I suspect they have huge NPA hidden  below carpet as Banks do not have privacy issues in disclosing  small retail loan defaults but Big defaults  NPA they   quotSee  quot privacy issues  even Supreme court agrees
2553,"This video is basically ill-informed on almost every aspect- The money one holds in bank A  C or in wallets is digital money for the user, not for RBI. RBI had to print notes in physical form somewhere at any point in time. e-rupi will be completely digital ie- produced and transferred.  RBI tends to gain control over anything which involves money, they are bestowed power and responsibility to control the inflation by a statute.   your views are highly political and misinformed. Even though you did not call any names, one can observe youre giving a negative connotation  to this initiative merely because you dont like the government.  This video needs to be reported on a mass"
2554,"Our economy is in such a bad shape spending printed money  thats worth nothing . We have so much to pray about .. Youve helped me and my family With your advices  I'magine investing $ 1000 and receiving $ 8,350 in few days with Ms Ana this inflation has increased drastically investment is the best idea"
2555,"Then its like bitcoin Then money with credit or debit done it by cbdc that be at  public banks,but not with RBI.RBI controls it   no. Cbdc is like wallet"
2556,Erupi is also instrument to send money but it is different than upi as in upi you send money directly from bank 2 bank by same person . In erupi one person can create voucher and give to some one else so they can use that voucher wherever it is decided by person who created it . It is exactly like amazon shopping voucher where someone can create voucher by paying amazon some money and give it to anyone to shop on Amazon only. In case of erupi usage is not limited to shopping but it can be used many places .Currently not much details is available but as per my knowledge this will be game changer as it will reduce misuse of money both in government and corporate. Government now can create erupi and give it to farmer to buy only seeds in the form of seed subsidy instead of giving money to farmer account( DBT) where it is not gurantee whether farmer will buy seed or something else. Corporate now can issue erupi voucher to there employee for there outstation visits for hotel access and travel expense instead of forcing employee to submit proof of expense Health insurance company can s I'mply go away with cashless card instead they can issue erupi to there customer which can only be used in designated hospital which will save there Hugh money. Its usage can be many in future we will just see this to happen. Once the adoption rate goes up  cash economy will vanish over long term.  Why do you not see these benefits from cbdc Rgs. Drdurgadoss. Drdd
2557,They are  just trying to monitor our every transactions more deeply
2558,Good explanation but the title of the video is inaccurate. e-RUPI and Digital Rupee (CBDC) are different. The video title assumes both to be same.
2559,This Rajan guy believes that India should not focus on manufacturing at all. He is probably the only wellwisher of any country to think that . This is just one of his focus areas and I have almost 0 trust in things he is concerned about so much so that if he is criticising any decision of Indian govt I tend to get a positive feeling about that decision already . What happens with CBDC only time will tell. Lets see how this exper I'ment goes.
2560,Good analysis
2561,No need to print money. All digital  You say 92 ℅ money is digital. You are right.  But rbi has to print all 100 ℅ of it. For anyone has right and can withdraw all his money to cash. So cash has to be printed anyways
